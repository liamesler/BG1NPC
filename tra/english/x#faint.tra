@0    = ~Listen, you imbecile townling! Bears only attack if you jump on them. Walk carefully, and we would not have to assassinate the poor beasts.~
@1    = ~Yes, ma'am.~
@2    = ~I was just hunting, Faldorn. Natural-like. How could Shadow Druids possibly be against it?~
@3    = ~I have no time for tip-toeing around bears, Faldorn!~
@4    = ~I just like killing bears. Makes me feel so  superior to the dumb beasts.~
@5    = ~Why don't you keep watch, Faldorn? Then you can warn us in time, and we'd avoid slaying innocent beasts.~
@6    = ~Ignorance is no excuse! You eat what you kill, <CHARNAME>. Next time you shoot a bear, I will make you swallow it whole!~
@7    = ~*grin* See that you do, druid, see that you do.~
@8    = ~Please, be reasonable... well, as reasonable as you *can*. We stalk through the forest. Sometimes we disturb a beast and have to kill it... I have no time for tip-toeing around bears, Faldorn!~
@9    = ~MAKE time, <CHARNAME>. It's an innocent life we are talking about!~
@10   = ~You are only pretending to be Nature's friend! I will not shame myself by guiding you through the forest!~
@11   = ~Well spoken, <CHARNAME>. *nods* So be it.~
@12   = ~I warned you!~
@13   = ~Where are you going? The carcass is right here. Sit down and have your dinner!~
@14   = ~Uhm... Faldorn, I am sorry about the bear, but you cannot really expect me to eat this one?~
@15   = ~Alright. Hey, everyone, set up the camp! We are having a feast!~
@16   = ~Only if you fry it for me, cookie...~
@17   = ~I'm not going to obey some crazy kid with twigs in her hair!~
@18   = ~You will eat it, and you will eat it raw!~
@19   = ~Grr! It was supposed to be a lesson, not an excuse for burning more trees...~
@20   = ~But what can one expect from a townling? Grr!~
@21   = ~You have exhausted my good will! Defend yourself, Nature's enemy!~
@22   = ~Grr!~
@23   = ~I take it, you do not approve? Heh, I can see why. The air is so thick with love, one can brew a potion out of it!~
@24   = ~Keep your 'grrs' to yourself!~
@25   = ~HA! Take it from the druid, <CHARNAME>, there is no such thing as love elixir! Since the whole *love* thing was invented by civilized folk to substitute for their natural urges, which they thought 'inappropriate'! Only a charlatan would claim to induce that which does NOT exist!~
@26   = ~Well, one of those days you should show me how to do it the RIGHT 'natural' way. *wink*~
@27   = ~If love did not exist, Faldorn, it was well worth inventing it. Not that you'd understand.~
@28   = ~Yes, yes, I know - mating is what *you* dream of on starry nights...~
@29   = ~Illuminating. Now let's go.~
@30   = ~When I look at a certain lady... I'd settle for a lust elixir, Faldorn...~
@31   = ~When I look at a certain man... I'd settle for a lust elixir, Faldorn...~
@32   = ~I'll call for mates when the time comes, like every other bitch. Fight for me then. Words now will do you no good.~
@33   = ~Dream? *she howls* What I am - a townling?~
@34   = ~One part powder of cassia, three damiana leaves, one part lotus petals-~
@35   = ~Argh, forget it. If you ever need one - I'll do it for you. Moon teas, brewed improperly, can leave a person forever cold...~
@36   = ~No, you aren't! You are a beast-torturer! The wrath of Shadow Druids have found you!~
@37   = ~Beautiful land... if only it was uninhabited! Grr! It smells foul!~
@38   = ~Ruins. *nods approvingly* That's the state I'd like to see all the civilizations in. The sooner the forest claims this land back, the better.~
@39   = ~Grr! Do not dare to slay one more! That last one, it was with a babe, I swear!~
@40   = ~Can't you count, you fool?! Another innocent death here, and I will off you for your rape of the Great Mother!~
@41   = ~You are defiling nature, townling. I can stomach it no more. I can't stand against you, but nor will I aid you further till you come to your senses. Find me in my grove, if you change your ways.~
@42   = ~Grr, I wish your name had imprinted one of the trees' virtues on you - their sage quietude.~
@43   = ~A townling is badmouthing a servant of nature? Death to him! Wait, why are you in town, druid? Are you one of those perverted druids who teach us that cities - Never mind for now. First to killing the mage!~
@44   = ~Blind fool! I will not let you kill a druid to defend on a word of some mageling!~
@45   = ~You are among friends, Corsone. Well done! Apart from pretending, that is.~
@46   = ~Where the beast walks-~
@47   = ~-and shadows dance.~
@48   = ~I am glad to meet you, sister. I was alone for so long among these so-called druids, who talk about compromises while the forests disappear.~
@49   = ~Walk to the West, brother, and you'll come to my grove. Tell the tale of your accomplishments there, and you will find yourself among friends.~
@50   = ~Thank you, sister.~
@51   = ~Do not look at me, <CHARNAME>! I *wish* I could claim such a deed! But I did not kill the pseudo-druids here!~
@52   = ~*snorts* There is nothing magical about poisons like that. You take a leaf of durman-flower and -~
@53   = ~Perhaps, that what it was, druid.~
@54   = ~Grr! Mages! A druid would have recognized the difference between a magical potion and a natural brew!~
@55   = ~We should release the beast, not slaughter it! It did not come to this wretched place out of its own volition!~
@56   = ~I promise you that the poor cubs would feast on his corpse!~
@57   = ~Hatchlings, rather than cubs, but it makes no difference. Go, Faldorn. Come talk to me afterwards.~
@58   = ~How did it go?~
@59   = ~It saddens me to report that the cruel man had perverted the nature of wyverns, and they have attacked us who came to deliver them from thralldom.~
@60   = ~The hatchlings are dead, then? A pity. But what of the human?~
@61   = ~He was returned to the Great Mother, so she could remold him into a natural being.~
@62   = ~That is good to hear. You have done well, Faldorn.~
@63   = ~Archdruid Amarande, I will lead them into the mines.~
@64   = ~The intention is noble, but until I see the results of your expedition, I am wary of these folk. They reek of civilizations, and their weapons are of cured metal.~
@65   = ~Return to me, once you have destroyed the mines, and I might revise my opinion of you.~
@66   = ~Report, Faldorn!~
@67   = ~The mines were flooded, Archdruid Amarande.~
@68   = ~So this blight on Toril's fair face is gone? A small task, but it can serve as a good example that our efforts are not in vain.~
@69   = ~If I may, Archdruid...~
@70   = ~I listen to you.~
@71   = ~The mines had fallen, but to complete my quest I must go further and enter Baldur's Gate itself, find the lair of the Iron Throne and exact my vengeance! My companions here are prepared to do just that...~
@72   = ~You have my permission. Let the new allegiance be forged. As a sign of Shadow Druid's favor, let me bestow this gift upon you.~
@73   = ~I abhor having to leave peaceful forests and having to walk into the desecrated bowels of the Great Mother. But I will do what I must to purge the parasites from the mines, and I will see the Iron Throne punished for what they have done!~
@74   = ~Glad you recognized me! I have not been away yet... and you already refer to me in the third person!~
@75   = ~Child, what does your name mean in the Great Cycle of Nature? Nothing. Now hurry, and do not forget to oppose civilization at every turn!~
@76   = ~To kill the cat? To kill the cat?! To kill that tormented poor hunter, locked in the stone bag of the city?! Grr! Do not even think of doing it, <CHARNAME>!~
@77   = ~Grr! Carry a message to your mother - keep the cubs away from the temptations of the man-made world, and they'd be safe.~
@78   = ~Those were the spiders that killed him...~
@79   = ~Your brother trusted a *thing* made by a smith's hand more than his kin's judgment. The arrogant fool deserved his death.~
@80   = ~May... maybe, but what does it matter now?!~
@81   = ~<CHARNAME>! It's a wolf chasing a chicken... we should not intervene in the cycle of life... WAIT A MINUTE! It's TALKING! Abhorrent humans! Could not leave poor chick to his clucking! Tell me creature who - NO! Do not *tell* me anything! I would not encourage you to act in an unnatural way!~
@82   = ~Buc-becaw-kill-the-wolf! Buc-becaw-stupid!~
@83   = ~Always remember that because of you a wolf had died.~
@84   = ~And good thing it is...~
@85   = ~What?! How dare you?! This noble beast was worth ten of your kind! Perhaps I can even the score by sending you after the wolf!~
@86   = ~Er... of course. I... I apologize, druid.~
@87   = ~You have a remarkable gift for angering people, Melicamp.~
@88   = ~Your trade is an affront to Nature, necromancer! On the other hand, the stench from the sewers is so foul that the bodies must be rotting there. I care not that they poison the city's water supply, but they pollute the Sea of Swords itself.~
@89   = ~Grr! Let us do the dung beetles' work this once, <CHARNAME>!~
@90   = ~Here, <CHARNAME>, here is another awful consequence of civilization! A wild beast finishes his kill and eats it! But "cultured" beings satisfy their hunger by slaughtering enslaved cows and pigs - so their natural instinct to kill for food gets perverted into a desire to murder and cause pain!~
@91   = ~We'd all be better off to avoid company of town-minded men for some time... not all of us are as fortunate as you, and may take their leave straight away.~
@92   = ~Despair not, sister, you will soon return to the starlit woods.~
@93   = ~Grr! Wisdom cannot be imparted from a scroll! It is a natural thing, not an oatmeal recipe!~
@94   = ~If you shared the beach with them as a normal beast would, and not tried to take more than your share of the sea bounty with your nets out and sell in this rotten city, you'd not have been chased away!~
@95   = ~Grr! Your eyes are death! Cold gaze, cold! Stay back, you fools.~
@96   = ~Grrr! The drow's scimitars are pretty and sharp, but the Emerald Ray scimitar is what I want. That's the proper weapon for a druid. Did I tell you that it was forged from Kador's the Burner sickle? Kador was a famous Shadow Druid... if only I had it!~
@97   = ~For the good cause, druid, I would fight with my bare hands.~
@98   = ~Or with boulders... yes, boulders are good.~
@99   = ~*smiles* If you are of the giantkin.~
@100  = ~Grr! Lead us, dryad, and I swear that the enemies of nature will be destroyed!~
@101  = ~Thank you, O servant of Silvanus.~
@102  = ~You... you brought dishonor upon me! I am not *welcome* in the wood! I HATE you, <CHARNAME>! Grrr! I will show you the proper way!~
@103  = ~Please, help me, druid!~
@104  = ~You... you are a trickster! I HATE you, <CHARNAME>! Grrr!~
@105  = ~GRRR! Luckily ankhegs do not have the limit for killing hunters. Stupid townling! Ankhegs do not destroy land, it's the farmers who do with their cruel plows and gluttonous beasts!~
@106  = ~*sniffs* You stink unnatural-like, worse than townlings with their perfume. Stay in the woods, boy, take my advice.~
@107  = ~I will slay you for your affront to nature, pale townling!~
@108  = ~That's a new one, to be sure. But it matters not. You are dead, druid, though I have heard that your ilk gives death little significance.~
@109  = ~Do not invoke the Great Mother's name! You and your like had corrupted her, used her kindness, and perverted her very essence. The Great Mother favoring farmers... how foul is that! Soon, very soon, the Shadow Druids will cure her from this evil sorcery.~
@110  = ~Grr! And Kethalem teaches that madness is peculiar to the interbred families!~
@150 = ~Ah, it's you again. Any luck tracking down that mage Gervisse?~
@151 = ~No, not yet. We'll go look for him right now.~
@152 = ~We've talked to Gervisse, and he says that it was you who's been scaring the twins and that you intend to kidnap them. I think I'm getting rid of you now!~
@153 = ~That's very foolish of you. Taste, then, the fury of Voltine!~
@154 = ~<CHARNAME>, Archdruid Amarande has given clear instruction. We must make haste.~
@155 = ~As I recall, you were supposed to lead us to a mine.~
@156 = ~Make haste to what?~
@157 = ~My time is my own. You will not place demands on it.~
@158 = ~Of course! After all, we must follow the vague instructions of every unwashed lunatic we encounter!~
@159 = ~Yes, yes, I will lead you there. The mine is a gaping wound in the Great Mother, but it is also the source of the imbalance that troubles this region.~
@160 = ~Do you mean the Nashkel Mines?~
@161 = ~What, exactly, are you talking about?~
@162 = ~Where does it lie?~
@163 = ~Faldorn, I will give the orders, here, not the Archdruid.~
@164 = ~The mines! They are a gaping wound in the Great Mother, but also the source of the imbalance that troubles this region.~
@165 = ~Fool! The mine is a gaping wound in the Great Mother, but it is also the source of the imbalance that troubles this region.~
@166 = ~How dare you mock the wisdom of the Archdruid?! The mine is a gaping wound in the Great Mother, but it is also the source of the imbalance that troubles this region.~
@167 = ~I don't really care.~
@168 = ~No, although they must be cleansed before we can purge the evil threatening Cloakwood. Once that is done, we can gather the information we need to pursue Archdruid Amarande's quest.~
@169 = ~No, that boil has been lanced. Nor are they the only mines rending Her flesh. We must look further, seek information. The mines the Archdruid spoke of lie elsewhere, and it is our quest to find them.~
@170 = ~Archdruid Amarande would have us cleanse the mines that lie near Cloakwood. First, we must seek wisdom to divine their location. Let us go about our tasks and gather information. That will lead us to our goal.~
@171 = ~Somewhere not far from Cloakwood, but we must first seek wisdom to divine their location. Let us go about our tasks and gather information. That will lead us to our goal.~
@172 = ~Grrrr! You will serve that Balance whether you will it or no! Even as we go about our tasks, we will be led to fulfil this quest.~
@173 = ~Even so, you will still serve the balance. As we go about our tasks, we will be led to fulfil this quest.~
@174 = ~Go make friends with it then, but I'm leaving!~
@175 = ~Be strong! Go with the Nature's blessings.~
@1001 = ~You will be rewarded for your sacrifice. Farewell.~
@1002 = ~Listen, just rid me of this damnable nuissance, all right?~
