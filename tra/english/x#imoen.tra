@0    = ~So, <CHARNAME>, how ya doing?~
@1    = ~I'm fine, Imoen. Thanks for asking. You have something on your mind?~
@2    = ~I've been better. Do *you* have something on your mind?~
@3    = ~Don't bother me now, Imoen. Get back in line.~
@4    = ~I still can't believe that Gorion is dead.~
@5    = ~*sadly* Me too.~
@6    = ~Is that why you don't talk much lately? All quiet and stuff...~
@7    = ~Gorion is dead, mysterious assassins are after me, and I can't even start imagining how to survive another day. It all happened so suddenly!~
@8    = ~Yes, and I have a lot more on my mind.~
@9    = ~You were always the talkative one. I'm more the silent type, remember? Don't worry, I'm still the same old <CHARNAME>.~
@10   = ~Not really. Was wonderin' how you were feeling. Seeing if you were okay and all. You don't talk much lately... all quiet and stuff.~
@11   = ~I just have a lot on my mind. I'm still the same old <CHARNAME>. Don't worry.~
@12   = ~Hmph. I guess 'crabby' is the answer!~
@13   = ~Good. I'd hate to see this eat away at ya. We'll get him, you know. That guy, whoever he was, who killed your dad. We'll find out who he is, and pay him back good!~
@14   = ~And don't even think of ditching me, either. I know what I'm doing, and I'm in this as much as you. I liked Gorion, and you're my best friend.~
@15   = ~I'm your best friend too, whether you know it or not. You can count on me, and don't you forget it!~
@16   = ~I can't make any promises, Imoen. I intend to assemble the most efficient group possible. Your skills may end up being redundant.~
@17   = ~What brings this on, Imoen? I don't think I've ever seen you act this way!~
@18   = ~I'd hate to see this eat away at ya. We'll get him, ya know. That guy, whoever he was, who killed your dad. We'll find out who he is, and pay him back good!~
@19   = ~Redundant? I'll show you redundant! You need me, no matter what you think. You won't be able to get rid of me so easy! Eh, don't mind me.~
@20   = ~I'm just mad, that's all... mad, sad and a little worried, I guess. I'll get over it. Heh. I was trying to make you feel better, and now I'm all worked up.~
@21   = ~Come on, let's go find an evil dragon's lair or something to loot. Um, on second thought, a hobgoblin cave is more your speed. Or maybe a xvart village? Hmmm. I'll have to think about this one...~
@22   = ~Here we are, traveling the good road. Some grand 'adventure' we're having, huh? Not exactly what we used to daydream about, but still, kinda exciting, I guess. I'd rather be out here, going places and doing things, than be stuck in Candlekeep, cleaning out stables and turning down beds.~
@23   = ~It has been interesting, to say the least. Not quite what I had in mind either, but it's not like I have a choice.~
@24   = ~I don't know. I would've been happy in Candlekeep, I think. I'd rather have some peace and security right now, rather than all this hardship.~
@25   = ~Yes, the whole world is out there. Power, wealth, all just waiting for me. I intend to grab as much as I can!~
@26   = ~You're babbling again, Imoen. You know how much I hate it when you do that! Please, keep a lid on it.~
@27   = ~That's 'we' remember? And yeah, 'spose we don't have much choice at that. Still, we can do a lot of good, I think.~
@28   = ~I guess so. You worry too much, you old fiddle-faddle. As for me, I plan to have some fun!~
@29   = ~That's good enough for you, I guess. As for me, I plan to have some fun!~
@30   = ~Well! You're being rude today! Guess I'll just keep quiet and wait for ya to come beggin' for something from little old Imoen.~
@31   = ~Wonder if they'll make a tale of our adventures? Just think, one day folks will be in the common room of some inn, maybe even the Candlekeep Inn, and ask a bard to tell 'em a tale of 'Imoen the Quick and her trusty side-kick, <CHARNAME>!'~
@32   = ~'Side-kick'...!?~
@33   = ~Oh, okay. We'll be partners, I 'spose. What ya think? 'Imoen the Quick' sounds good to you? Quick with the blade and wit! All the best heroes and heroines have handles. Hmmm, maybe 'Imoen the Terrible'? Nah, too dark. 'Imoen the Bold'? 'Imoen the Sly'? 'Imoen the Magnificent'? Hey that sounds pretty good!~
@34   = ~Um, how about 'Imoen the...'?~
@35   = ~Uh-huh. Imoen, the Pinnacle of Annoyance, the Epitome of Vexation and the Champion of Besetment!~
@36   = ~Shush you! I'm thinking! Where was I? I still kinda like 'Imoen the Quick'. Wonder if it's taken already...?~
@37   = ~Well here we are! Beregost. Whatcha think?~
@38   = ~I haven't seen enough of it yet to have much of an opinion.~
@39   = ~Too many people for me. I'm not very fond of cities.~
@40   = ~Looks great to me. What do you think we should do first?~
@41   = ~The only thing I'm interested in right now is a warm room with a soft bed and a roof over my head.~
@42   = ~You see one town, you've seen them all.~
@43   = ~We'll see what she has for us then! Uh... better let me do the talking, <CHARNAME>. A hayseed like you in a "big city" like this, oooh... pretty scary!~
@44   = ~Hayseed? When did you become so sophisticated, little Miss Worldly?~
@45   = ~We'll avoid the scoundrels only to fall into the hands of the law, knowing you. Better let ME do the talking.~
@46   = ~That's my plan! I'll just stand off to the side and look menacing.~
@47   = ~Ya just be anti-social then. We'll be better off if I do the talking, anyway. You'll just scare everyone away.~
@48   = ~Better that than the trouble you'll likely get us into. I think I better do the talking.~
@49   = ~Sure, sure; and if your quick words, wit and charm aren't enough, I'll just glower menacingly.~
@50   = ~Sure, sure; and if my good looks and your quick words aren't enough, I'll just glower menacingly. Truly, Imo, it's long past time you have learned to do that.~
@51   = ~I'm not anti-social. I just hate people.~
@52   = ~Let's find a nice place and get some rooms. I haven't had a hot bath in ages! They say Feldepost's is a good inn; we should try there.~
@53   = ~You take the bed. I've got dibs on the bath! I haven't had a hot bath in ages! They say Feldepost's is a good inn; we should try to find rooms there.~
@54   = ~Oh, I've been all over with Winthrop before we came to Candlekeep. You should know that! But... heh, guess you're right. I was kinda little at the time.~
@55   = ~Whatever you say. I'm just teasin' anyway.~
@56   = ~You're smarter than ya look! Guess there's hope for you, after all, hehe.~
@57   = ~That was almost funny, <CHARNAME>. I must be rubbin' off on ya.~
@58   = ~After that, I'm going shopping. We need some supplies. Let's see...~
@59   = ~We need a new frying pan, since you ruined the one we have.~
@60   = ~I ruined? As I recall, YOU were the one who left it on the fire all night...~
@61   = ~Whatever you say.~
@62   = ~Details, details. Was yer idea to have me cook. Um... what else? Some new blankets, soap, lantern oil, spare tent pegs... er... I think I kinda misplaced your hunting knife so we'll have to get a new one of those. I need some new clothes, too. My pink tunic got ripped in that last fight.~
@63   = ~Um... Imoen? ALL of your tunics are pink... and cloaks... and boots... and gloves...~
@64   = ~Me, too! I wonder if they have any elvish jewelery? Ah, I *always* dreamed of buying something Evereska-made...~
@65   = ~But that was my favorite! Soooo... I'll need a new one! There's lots we need. Hope we have enough money...~
@66   = ~Well, c'mon, slowpoke. I wanna have a look around.~
@67   = ~Whatever you say, grouchy.~
@68   = ~This is a good place to celebrate!~
@69   = ~Celebrate? What's the occasion?~
@70   = ~What do you mean? What is there to celebrate?~
@71   = ~Great! Let's have a party! Um... what are we celebrating, again?~
@72   = ~What are you babbling about now, Imoen?~
@73   = ~What I'm "babbling" about, O Life of the Party, is...~
@74   = ~Your birthday, of course! Happy birthday, <CHARNAME>!~
@75   = ~Heh. I guess today is as good as any.~
@76   = ~Hmmm... <DAYANDMONTH> is not my birthday, Imoen.~
@77   = ~I'm in no mood to celebrate my "birthday" today, or any other day, for that matter.~
@78   = ~You bet!~
@79   = ~It could be! How do you know, huh? Today's as good as any I say! Besides...~
@80   = ~Suit yerself, 's yer loss. More cake for me then! Hehe!~
@81   = ~The nice thing about not knowing your birthday is that you can celebrate it whenever you want! Let other people have their boring old same-day-every-year birthdays. My way is more fun!~
@82   = ~Here! Take this. It's yer birthday present! Um... I know, we have lots of money and stuff, but I didn't want to spend *our* gold on *your* present. Soooo... I made it myself! Whatcha think?~
@83   = ~It's beautiful, Imoen! What is it?~
@84   = ~It's... um... er... what is it, exactly?~
@85   = ~What is this... thing?~
@86   = ~It's a necklace, goofy! Or amulet, if ya like. Here. I'll put it on ya.~
@87   = ~It's perfect for you. Really brings out the color of your eyes. Goes well with any outfit, too! Hehe!~
@88   = ~And this part, here. These pieces? They were... it was Gorion's. I found it on his... that night, ya know? I woulda given it to ya earlier, but it was all broken. So sad, like that...~
@89   = ~So! I made a necklace out of it! It's got some pretty rocks, and some beads, and some nice silk string I've been saving... oh, lots of stuff! I hope you like it. Wear it, won't ya? It'll protect ya... Gorion's spirit and such.~
@90   = ~Perhaps. We should get moving!~
@91   = ~It's lovely. I will wear it always, Imoen. Thank you very much.~
@92   = ~I can't promise I'll wear it, but I'll keep it safe. Thank you, Imoen.~
@93   = ~Thank you, Imoen. But you know what I think? There is someone who needs protection more than I... I shall give it to... that person. Thank you, Imoen.~
@94   = ~Not before we've had your party, I hope!~
@95   = ~Sure thing! Heck, 'twas nuthin'.~
@96   = ~This calls for a round of drinks! And some cake! Oooh... and candles too!~
@97   = ~'Bout time you woke up! Uh... you okay, <CHARNAME>? You look kinda pale, like you've seen a ghost. You have some bad dreams, or something? Wouldn't surprise me.~
@98   = ~Dream isn't the word, Imoen. Nightmare is more like it.~
@99   = ~Dreams? Yes. More strange than bad, really.~
@100  = ~Just some bad dreams, Imoen. Probably just something I ate. Like your cooking!~
@101  = ~It's nothing I wish to talk about.~
@102  = ~Sure sounded like it, alright!~
@103  = ~Huh. Well, they sounded bad to me!~
@104  = ~Ha. Yer a funny one. Told ya I couldn't cook. Serves you right! But these didn't sound like just any old bad dreams...~
@105  = ~Well, okay. Just remember, you can tell me anything, alright? Suit yerself, though. As for me, I'm gonna take a nap first chance I get. Could hardly sleep last night with all your carrying on.~
@106  = ~You were tossin' and turnin'... mumblin' in yer sleep too. Loudly! Kept me up half the night, you did. Anything you want to talk about?~
@107  = ~No. No I don't.~
@108  = ~Yes. That would make me feel better, I think. I was back in Candlekeep, only... *you relate your dream*~
@109  = ~Might as well. I was back in Candlekeep, only... *you relate your dream*~
@110  = ~Sounds kinda creepy. Still, I'm glad Gorion seemed happy in your dream. I... I don't know why, but I'm also glad you took the other path. Anyway, no harm done, I guess? It was just a dream... right?~
@111  = ~Yes... just a dream.~
@112  = ~Not just a dream, Imoen. I'm different, somehow. I can heal people. All I have to do is touch them.~
@113  = ~A dream yes, but also something more. I have a healing touch, though an ability not from my deity. It comes from within me.~
@114  = ~Sounds creepy to me... really creepy! I don't like the sound of it at all! Poor <CHARNAME>... But it was just a dream, right? No harm done?~
@115  = ~Perhaps not, but I've gained something, a power. I'm able to draw the life force from something, wounding it, while at the same time healing myself.~
@116  = ~Not at all. In fact, I feel invigorated! I've gained something as well, a power of a sort. I can now draw from the very life essence of a creature, healing myself in the process. Perhaps greater gifts await me in the future...~
@117  = ~Harm? Not that I am aware of, no. I do, however, have a new... ability... I guess you could say. Not a spell, but something innate. I believe it is something very much like the Archmage Larloch's famous Minor Drain incantation. It allows me to wound a creature at range, while healing myself of damage, and, perhaps, even granting me extra vitality. Intriguing...~
@118  = ~Well... I guess that's useful at least. It sounds very strange, though, to wake up after some dream and just *know* you can do something magical.~
@119  = ~You just take it easy for a bit, okay? I'll get things packed.~
@120  = ~Good morning, <CHARNAME>. Didn't sound like you slept well last night. Me neither. More dreams, I guess?~
@121  = ~Yes, another dream. Do you wish to hear it?~
@122  = ~If you must know, yes. I suppose you want to hear it, don't you?~
@123  = ~Nah. I just couldn't sleep with all yer snorin'.~
@124  = ~It is nothing I wish to talk about. Pack up. We have much to do today.~
@125  = ~I do. More daggers and strange voices?~
@126  = ~Yes. I was in the bandit camp and... *you relay your dream to Imoen*~
@127  = ~On second thought, I don't wish to talk about it. Let's just go. We've a lot to accomplish today.~
@128  = ~Hmmph. 'Tis your snoring more like it! You attract every monster fer miles, the moment yer head hits the pillow. It's a wonder we can ever rest outside of an inn. Puffguts has a sure cure for snoring. He used to give it to some of the guests. Ya want it?~
@129  = ~Let me guess: a cup of brandy. Right?~
@130  = ~No way! Do not you understand that I am doing it on purpose? Let's go fight all those monsters my thunderous snoring had attracted!~
@131  = ~Imoen! Just... bugger off.~
@132  = ~I 'spose yer right. I don't want to butt into your business. I'm just worried 'bout ya is all.~
@133  = ~Yep. And if that didn't do the trick, a pint of beer to wash it down! Come ta think of it... that's his cure fer everything! Seriously though, <CHARNAME>... you wanna talk about it?~
@134  = ~I suppose I should. Do you really want to hear it?~
@135  = ~Actually, yes. Are you sure you want to hear it?~
@136  = ~No. No, I don't. Sorry, Imoen. Let's just get going. We've got things to do, after all.~
@137  = ~That voice is scary, <CHARNAME>. I don't think you should listen to it. I just know it! Something about it is... I dunno... wrong. You need to fight it. I'll help you the best I can.~
@138  = ~That voice scares me, <CHARNAME>. Sounds like it scared you too. That's good. I don't trust it. Not at all. Nope. I don't. You keep fighting it, <CHARNAME>. I'll help ya, if I can.~
@139  = ~More powers too, I guess, huh?~
@140  = ~I thought so. Well... you just use 'em to do what you know is right. Gorion would like that. Me, too. Guess it doesn't matter where they come from.~
@141  = ~C'mon! I'll fetch ya somethin' to eat, while you... er... comb your hair or something. Yer a wreck!~
@142  = ~Wow. Tarnesh's spellbook is pretty neat! I think I can learn some o' this stuff.~
@143  = ~Look! Here's somethin'... Hey? Think I can turn ya into a frog?~
@144  = ~Hold on, lemme try...~
@145  = ~Manos! Potentis! PAH...!~
@146  = ~Whoa! Hold on, Imoen! You're no wizard. You shouldn't be fooling around with that. I don't want you to hurt yourself.~
@147  = ~Ha ha. Very funny, Imoen. That's party treasure. You shouldn't be messing around with that, you could ruin it. Now hand it over.~
@148  = ~Cut it out, Imoen! It would serve you right if YOU were the one to turn into a toad. Hand it over, or else.~
@149  = ~Aw, don't worry about me. I was only kiddin'.~
@150  = ~Yeesh. Some sense of humor YOU have!~
@151  = ~Well... looks like someone's already turned YOU into something... a JERK! Thanks for the 'concern' though. Humph.~
@152  = ~Those 'spells' or whatever, the things in the back? They look kinda important. I won't mess with those.~
@153  = ~But these lil' old things in the front... Betcha even I could learn some of them. I'm gonna try, anyway.~
@154  = ~Well, I suppose it will be all right. Just be careful, okay?~
@155  = ~I don't think that's a good idea, Imoen. Best to let someone who knows what they're doing take care of that.~
@156  = ~No chance, Imoen. Hand it over. I won't ask again.~
@157  = ~Hey! I told ya! Dontcha worry 'bout me. I'm no dummy. I know what I'm doin'.~
@158  = ~I'll be 'slingin' spells' in no time. Haha!~
@159  = ~Spoil sport. I won't hurt your precious book. Here ya go...~
@160  = ~(I'll just take a peek when you aren't looking. So there!)~
@161  = ~For your own good, I'll put this somewhere out of sight. YOUR sight.~
@162  = ~Fine, you old sour puss! I didn't want the stupid thing, anyway. Here's your smelly old book back.~
@163  = ~(We'll just see about that. Gotta sleep sometime, heh.)~
@164  = ~I'll take that, thank you. Keep your hands off next time.~
@165  = ~So that's Firewine Bridge!? Wow! Isn't it just so grand!? I wonder what it would have been like when it was actually in use.~
@166  = ~Bah! You've seen one bridge, you've seen them all!~
@167  = ~Yes, it just goes to show you how grand things can withstand the test of time.~
@168  = ~Yes, but it just goes to show you that humans and other races can do what they want, but nothing they do will last forever. Eventually everything will be forgotten and destroyed.~
@169  = ~Didn't you read about it at Candlekeep, or were you sleeping that day?~
@170  = ~I'm still wondering how they built it.~
@171  = ~Someone obviously woke up on the wrong side of <PRO_HISHER> blanket this morning.~
@172  = ~Yep. Hey I wonder if anything in Candlekeep would last this long?~
@173  = ~Nope. Most of the stuff wasn't built to last there.~
@174  = ~Doubtful. Even the old books they have are constantly being rewritten, in fear they might get destroyed soon.~
@175  = ~Who knows. I suppose it's possible.~
@176  = ~I'm sure if anything's left it'll be that library.~
@177  = ~Guess you're right. That's a sobering thought.~
@178  = ~So that's why they sit there copying the same book over and over again. And here I thought it was to make sure they had spare copies in case someone needed one and they couldn't find the original.~
@179  = ~Heh, yea I'm sure it'd be ole Puffguts. He refuses to leave there, no matter what.~
@180  = ~Well I guess that's likely, since they have so many enchantments and whatnot on it. I betcha that's what's still keepin' it from crumblin' down.~
@181  = ~It's not that old. Sure, it was built before anyone we know was alive, but that's not that long ago.~
@182  = ~Or stone-work. Magic is powerful, but it is unreliable.~
@183  = ~Uhm...I meant this bridge here. Not the library.~
@184  = ~Um... yeah...~
@185  = ~I guess so... well, anyways, it still is a grand bridge.~
@186  = ~No, if I tried, I probably fell asleep. Most of those history books that try to tell history exactly as it was are too dry.~
@187  = ~Um... yeah...~
@188  = ~Heya, Quayle! Come here for a second!~
@189  = ~*You look over at Imoen and notice that she picked up the assassin Tarnesh's spellbook, and is reading it.*~
@190  = ~Making any progress with that, Imoen?~
@191  = ~I hope you're being careful with that, Imoen. I don't want you or anyone else to get hurt.~
@192  = ~Imoen, leave that alone! What kind of trouble are you getting into, now?~
@193  = ~Imoen! Leave magic to those of us who are trained in arcane arts. When little rogues start fooling around with magic, they end up in trouble!~
@194  = ~What are you reading, Imoen? Anything interesting?~
@195  = ~Imoen. Put that away. I need you to be focused right now.~
@196  = ~Hmm? Oh! A little. I think.~
@197  = ~Quit worryin' already! I think I can understand some of it.~
@198  = ~O, <CHARNAME> the Great Archmage, thy... thy... he-he. Quit worryin' already! I think I can understand some of it.~
@199  = ~Hmm? Oh. Just readin' that guy Tarnesh's spellbook. I think I can understand some of it.~
@200  = ~Oh, all right. What a worry wart...~
@201  = ~Though, this stuff IS kinda complicated...~
@202  = ~Hey! I think I've got this one down pat. Yep. Easy as pie. Hold on, <CHARNAME>, this'll be fun...~
@203  = ~Why do I have a bad feeling about this?~
@204  = ~*wait for her to finish the 'spell'*~
@205  = ~Watch this!~
@206  = ~Hex-o! Prest-o!
Um... shabadoo?
Ooops!~
@207  = ~Heya, gramps!~
@208  = ~Wha?!? Huh? What... what? Imoen! Why does ya always come up behind me when I'm... when I'm thinkin'?~
@209  = ~Do you always think when asleep?~
@210  = ~I... er... gah, alright, alright, I'm awake now. *grumbles* What did you want me fer, then?~
@211  = ~*trying to look innocent* Oh, um... nothing... can't I just come and talk with you?~
@212  = ~Likely story. Listen, if I get wind of ya tryin' to steal me stuff, lass, I swears I'll put mousetraps in me bedrolls...~
@213  = ~Ouch! I wasn't stealin' nothing! I was just practicing my sneaks, and thought I'd warm up on you before I tried one of the others!~
@214  = ~I hope yer not implyin' I am somehow the least alert of this 'ere group? I'll have ya know I gots at least one eye on everyone all the time! And me pack too, ya little scamp.~
@215  = ~Really? That's kinda hard when you only got two eyes. How do you see anything else?~
@216  = ~Uh, huh. Yer still be needin' to work on them jokes more if ya wanna impress a dwarf with 'em.~
@217  = ~Nevermind, though. I'm makin' sure to keep a special watch on ya.~
@218  = ~Aw, c'mon, gramps! I'd never steal anything from you!~
@219  = ~Aye, aye, I know. Just kiddin' with ya, lass. Run along now and scare some other poor blighter, aye?~
@220  = ~Sure thing! *quietly* Though... mousetraps... heh, sounds like a challenge...~
@221  = ~Ahh! Civilization at last! Now I can get a good bath and relax for a change!~
@222  = ~Indeed, although I thought you liked adventuring, Imoen.~
@223  = ~'Course I do, but doesn't mean I don't like taking a few days off here and there. 'Sides, we gotta spend that money somehow, so might as well be on something I enjoy.~
@224  = ~Complicated? Nonsense, 'tis clear as a stream of the purest lymphatic fluid, but why concern yourself with such matters, when there are experts such as I to attend to them, dear child?~
@225  = ~Well, 'cause I'm kinda interested in magic, I guess.~
@226  = ~Guess?!? Then you must wait until you are certain. The Art requires severe and ceaseless self-discipline.~
@227  = ~Yeah, sure!~
@228  = ~I am pleased that my example has imparted that, at least. Now, where's Monty? Oh, well, I suppose you've pawed it thoroughly enough that you would have triggered any extant wards by now.~
@229  = ~Wards?~
@230  = ~Of course. All prudent mages trap their spellbooks against intrusion... and many imprudent mages do so as well. Such lovely sparkly colors. And the remains sometimes contain items worth the bother of picking them out of the goo.~
@231  = ~*gulp* er... thanks? I think...~
@232  = ~Careful with that, whelp! Such thoughts are no doubt beyond your meager comprehension, but have you given any consideration to the traps and wards a spellbook is likely to have?~
@233  = ~(Not that there was anything there. I checked it myself and found nothing.)~
@234  = ~Luckily for you, I've disarmed the numerous and deadly traps in the book. They were hidden well, but not so well as to deceive a wizard of Thay.~
@235  = ~(Yes. That should impress them suitably.)~
@236  = ~Um... thanks, Edwin. I guess.~
@237  = ~Thou should be wary of such, child. Spellbooks art oftimes warded and trapped 'gainst prying eyes and hands. And this Tarnesh, he was an evil man, no?~
@238  = ~Oh! Uh... heh. Guess I never thought of that. *sigh* 'Spose I shouldn't fool 'round with it, huh?~
@239  = ~Not at all. I just advise caution. I noticed thine interest in yon book. I've ensured it will cause no harm to thee or the rest of us.~
@240  = ~I am most curious as to what thou wilst make of it.~
@241  = ~Alas, <CHARNAME> is correct. Nothing anyone does matters in the long run. It's all forgotten and destroyed eventually.~
@242  = ~*grumble* 'Tisn't so grand. We Dwarves've been buildin' grander bridges'n this centuries afore this were supposed ta be built. Why, I'd be none too surprised ta find out that many a Dwarven mason were hired fer the job.~
@243  = ~Wow. So did you're clan ever build something like this?~
@244  = ~O' course they did lass! Jus' cos our holds're underground don't mean we don't need bridges! Why, when our clan first settled, our minin' uncovered an open cavern, five thousand feet across, easy! And it be goin' down at least a thousand in the shallow parts. No way to cross it, either... no way to gets ta the ore that were surely beyond, nor bring it back. So we got our best stonemason ta build a bridge, an' glory below, what a bridge it was.~
@245  = ~Five thousand feet?!? That's... wow. How'd he do it?~
@246  = ~'Twas such a grand achievement, 'twas made into a short saga as part o' th' histories o' th' clan... but the tellin'd best wait till night, over th' campfire, where I can tell parts at a time.~
@247  = ~Why? How long is it?~
@248  = ~Oh, not long at all. If I leave out all the technical details, it'd take little less than a week...~
@249  = ~Fer humans and elves mayhap, but us dwarves were doin' so centuries afore. I'd bet ya they hired many a Dwarven mason to help 'stuct it. Aye, twould have been a grand operation. *looks somewhat gloomy*~
@250  = ~Whoa, this is a new look for you. Why that face?~
@251  = ~*sighs* Don't ya see? Canna ya imagine all that money changin' hands, all them workers, messangers and 'portant people comin' to maken sure things keep movin' along? An don'tcha be forgetten them guards to stop those theives and bandits, mind ya. Pro'lly some attacks on it as well. *sighs again* I coulda made me a fortune whilst this was being built.~
@252  = ~So, what do ya think, Xan?~
@253  = ~Why must I suffer doubly with knowing we're all doomed, and having to wear such... overwhelming clothing?~
@254  = ~I already told ya. It's for your own good. Once you're out of your dreary self-pitying attitude, I'll give you back your stuff, if you still want it.~
@255  = ~So you admit that my belongings were not "lost", as you said before? *sighs* These humans... Please, return my possessions.~
@256  = ~I dunno... you still seem rather downbeat. I mean, just a moment ago you were still complaining we were all doomed...~
@257  = ~We are, and wearing this motley clothing will not change it. *shrugs* Our foes know us all too well to be tricked now in believing that we are a traveling circus. Please, do me a courtesy and allow me to die in Evereskan GREY cloak.~
@258  = ~So, you ready to admit I was right?~
@259  = ~At this point, I will admit almost anything to rid myself of this outfit.~
@260  = ~No, no! That just won't do! You need to be perky and cheerful!~
@261  = ~If I can get my clothing back, I will indeed be a measure more cheerful than I am now. Not much, mind you, as I am still fighting other lost causes, but my heart will rejoice at not hearing the others call me "that doomed mage in pink".~
@262  = ~If I can get my clothing back, I will indeed be a measure more cheerful than I am now. Not much, mind you, as I am still fighting other lost causes, but my heart will rejoice at not hearing the others to sing that awful verse Garrick composed. *sighs*... the doomed mage in pink, indeed...~
@263  = ~Well since this doesn't seem to be working exactly as I planned, I guess its okay, especially since you say you'll be a bit more cheerful.~
@264  = ~Few things, though. The hair and nails will take some time to return to normal, and you'll have to wash your face off really good to get all that makeup off.~
@265  = ~By the way, dontcha think I'm done with you. I've got other ideas up my sleeve.~
@266  = ~*sighs* Corellon, have mercy on me... Yet another lost cause to fight...~
@267  = ~Wow, this is quite well done. I wonder where he got it from?~
@268  = ~What are you looking at there?~
@269  = ~This statuette belongs to me, m'lady Imoen. Would you be so kind and return it, please?~
@270  = ~Hmm? When did you show up?~
@271  = ~It doesn't matter. You have the statuette my mother did give me for luck when I first went to join the Order. Please, m'lady Imoen, give it back to me.~
@272  = ~I see. *An evil grin crosses Imoen's face.* You know, Ajantis, I hear there's a tradition with this statue.~
@273  = ~There is?~
@274  = ~Of course! I thought you knew when you gave it to me.~
@275  = ~With all due respect, m'lady, I did no such thing.~
@276  = ~Yep, when a guy gives this to a girl, it signifies his undying love for her. I had no idea you felt that way before this, Ajantis.~
@277  = ~B-but I didn't give it to you, you took it!~
@278  = ~*shouts* Heya, everyone, Ajantis here has declared his undying love for me!~
@279  = ~*turning a bright shade of red* I did no such thing!~
@280  = ~But you gave me this gift. Are you saying you don't love me, then?~
@281  = ~I never-~
@282  = ~How could you!? Toying with a woman's heart like that! And here you want to be all noble! Well fine, here, take your stupid item! I don't need it. *throws the statuette at Ajantis*~
@283  = ~I'm sorry, m'lady Imoen, I didn't know you felt that way.~
@284  = ~*pauses for a moment and starts rolling on the ground laughing* You should have seen your face there! It was soooo serious.~
@285  = ~It was quite an ignoble thing to do!~
@286  = ~Come on, I was only joking. *goes and picks up the statuette and hands it to Ajantis* Don't burst a vein over it. You need to lighten up and have some fun, once in a while.~
@287  = ~Ya know, Alora, being small does have its 'vantages.~
@288  = ~Too right! Yep you would have made a decent halfling, Imoen, not as good as me, of course, but decent.~
@289  = ~But being tall has advantages too, ya know.~
@290  = ~Such as?~
@291  = ~Huh? Where'd Mr. Cuddles go?~
@292  = ~Up here! *dangles a stuffed dragon above Alora's head*~
@293  = ~*jumping up and down trying to grab it* Hey! Give Mr. Cuddles back! He's afraid of heights!~
@294  = ~See? There are some advantages to being tall! Ouch! *drops Mr. Cuddles as she staggers and rubs her shin*~
@295  = ~Look what you did to poor Mr. Cuddles! Dropping him on the dirty ground!~
@296  = ~Hey, Branwen, if you worship the 'Lord of Battles', how come your god sees fit to let ya heal people, instead of throwing nice crispy fireballs?~
@297  = ~If you really wish to know why healing is a vital component of warfare, dear child, perhaps you would like me to withhold it from you for a while, until you figure it out?~
@298  = ~*gulps nervously* Aww, I was just teasin', Brany.~
@299  = ~So, a cleric and a mage walk into a bar...~
@300  = ~Child, please. No more horrid jokes. My ears are still getting used to being able to hear things again after having been stone for so long, be kind to them.~
@301  = ~Aww. Spoilsport.~
@302  = ~So Coran, how often do you gotta leave town?~
@303  = ~I usually do not stay in one place for too long, so I am rarely forced to leave. I prefer to slip away unnoticed.~
@304  = ~Yeah, but there must've been some time you couldn't get away fast enough!~
@305  = ~I tend to forget about such inconveniences the next day. Life is too short for regrets and unpleasant memories.~
@306  = ~You ever worry about what'll happen one day if you flirt with the wrong girl, Coran?~
@307  = ~No, not really. I'll deal with it when the time comes.~
@308  = ~There is, however, one thing I do dread.~
@309  = ~What's that? The tavern ran out of wine?~
@310  = ~Oh, wait, I know! You got beaten up by an angry husband?~
@311  = ~No, not that. I can manage in both situations quite nicely.~
@312  = ~Well then, what? You shouldn't keep a girl waiting.~
@313  = ~It is a good story, but you must promise that you will not tell anyone...~
@314  = ~Sure, no prob. I can keep a secret.~
@315  = ~Good. *Coran whispers to Imoen.*~
@316  = ~*falls to the ground, laughing hysterically* That's the funniest thing I've heard in a while! Hey, everyone, guess what? Coran was so drunk flirtin' that he only noticed that it was another guy when he brought him up to his room! And that guy thought that Coran was a BARMAID!~
@317  = ~*laughs* Ah, yes. Tell a woman to keep it a secret, and you do not have to hire a town crier to make the whole of Baldur's Gate know... and the northern regions of Amn as well.~
@318  = ~*still giggling* Sorry, sorry. It was just so funny I couldn't keep it in.~
@319  = ~To prevent such mishaps in the future I settled for wearing very plain clothes. Alas, life is full of sacrifices.~
@320  = ~Heh. Yea, that'd work. Prob'ly too well. I don't think you'll be attracting as many ladies, either!~
@321  = ~*winks* Luckily, women are too intent on the others dames' clothes to notice what men wear.~
@322  = ~Heya, Coran! Can I talk to you, alone that is, for a moment? *winks suggestively*~
@323  = ~What is it, Imoen?~
@324  = ~Well. There's been something that's been burning me up for some time, ya know, 'bout you that is. *moves in closer to Coran and wraps her arms around him*~
@325  = ~*grinning* That's why I love human maidens... they grow up so... suddenly and are filled with such sweet passion-~
@326  = ~*whispering in his ear* Yep! I've been holdin' my feelin's back for some time cuz of <CHARNAME>, but, ya know, it was just tearing me 'part so I just had to let ya know.~
@327  = ~O! Ouch! You... you hit me! You have quite sharp knees, girl. Be careful when moving them around next time. With better aim you could have left me without progeny.~
@328  = ~You're lucky I missed then cuz that's what I was hoping for! That was for ignoring your daughter! I despise creeps like you. I really HATE what you did to her! I hope you die and rot in the Nine Hells.~
@329  = ~*cringes* I certainly will, Imoen, for all men die. But today is not the day, thankfully. I would have hated to go with my last memory being a silly human girl and an ugly one at that. You look terrible when you scowl, do you know that?~
@330  = ~Heya, Dynaheir, got some free time?~
@331  = ~I am currently occupied with a matter of great import, and I asked of thee not to bother me with thine idle prattle thrice since yestereve.~
@332  = ~Idle chatter? I'd never waste anyone's time with idle chatter! Everything I say has GREAT importance to it. 'Course, some of it is obviously a little more subtle, and other stuff has a bit more of a flourish to it, but I'd never say anything that'd just waste time for the sake of wastin' it.~
@333  = ~*coughs politely* May I point out that thou just didst what I have implied? Thou wandered off on impertinent tangents, which hath no relevance to the question thou intended to pose.~
@334  = ~*puffs out her cheeks* Poo! I don't need to talk to you, anyways!~
@335  = ~I thought that thou dost not need to talk to me anymore.~
@336  = ~Huh? What'cha sayin' that for?~
@337  = ~Nevermind. I suppose I had better listen to thy question, or I'll never have your curious inquisitions end.~
@338  = ~Yep! That's me! Imoen the Persistent! So, I was wondering why you came all the way out here to the Sword Coast. Nothing too interesting here. Well, there is Waterdeep, home of Elminster, but since most people don't get to meet him, it's not all that special. I suppose there are some other places like Skullport or such... those might be interesting to visit, though most of the places aren't exactly part of the Coast.~
@339  = ~*quickly jumps in as Imoen takes a breath* Thou shoudst know that there is much more to any area than meets the eye, but as to the specific reason Minsc and I traveled hither, it is that I needed to.~
@340  = ~Needed to, huh? Sounds kinda vague. You aren't tryin' to dodge me, are you?~
@341  = ~Wherefore would I do such a thing? I have answered thine question. Make what thou wilt of it.~
@342  = ~I dunno... it really sounds like yer tryin' to dodge my question... Hey! You listenin' to me! Dynaheir! Hey, wait up! Don't leave me behind!~
@343  = ~Don't you get hot wearing those robes all the time?~
@344  = ~I'm perfectly fine. *Edwin scowls at Imoen as a bead of sweat runs slowly down Edwin's forehead.*~
@345  = ~See? You're sweating. You can't deny you're not all toasted inside those robes. *sniffs the air* Yep. Definitely, very warm!~
@346  = ~I might be sweating, yes, and you do have an amazing grasp of the obvious - but it is not from heat. It's from concentrating on not turning you into a nice piece of charcoal. (I would do it, too, but it's too damn hot already without casting another fireball.)~
@347  = ~Why you keep lookin' at me with that funny face?~
@348  = ~Alas, I have been found out. I guess there is no choice but to come clean now.~
@349  = ~Yep. You can't pull anything over ole Imoen here!~
@350  = ~Imoen, I've fallen in love with you.~
@351  = ~Wha-~
@352  = ~Your beauty - it shines like a beacon homing in on my heart! (I'll have to remember this lovey-dovey improvisation.)~
@353  = ~D-don't you have someone waiting for you?~
@354  = ~Alas, Skie, poor rich girl... Now, I see that I had but a youngster's fascination for her, compared to the overwhelming love I feel for you.~
@355  = ~Can you not see, our joining in this party was meant as a sign for us to be together. We are destined. Even our names sound the same: Imoen and Eldoth.~
@356  = ~Eww, quit creeping me out! I would never be seen with someone like you.~
@357  = ~As much as you may deny it, deep down, your heart, too, aches for me. I can imagine you reading those boring old dust covered books in the citadel of Candlekeep and picturing someone just like me waiting for you...~
@358  = ~Ugh. I'm feeling sick right now, and no, we don't have to continue this conversation later.~
@359  = ~You will resist your feeling forever, then, and reject me? Woe to me! But can I at least have a token to remember the love you did scorn from me? That book I mentioned or another would be enough. I will find solace in looking at the pages you once touched with your small hands.~
@360  = ~Huh, I'm sorry, but you'll have to go there yourself. I don't have any books. I can give you my vomit once I rid myself of this nauseous feeling, though.~
@361  = ~No, no, that would be unnecessary. You did not... erm... bring along an ancient scroll or two, either? No? Regrettable...~
@362  = ~Hey, Faldorn, why did your parents give you to the druids? Well, you are mean, and dirty, and stuff, now. But you weren't always like that, were you?~
@363  = ~My tribe's lands were hit by drought and frost for a few years. The prey became scarce and the streams went dry. Tempus, Auril and spirits of the ancestors did not listen to my people's pleas. Then the tribe elders decided to give the first newborn to the druids.~
@364  = ~Wow! Did it stop the drought?~
@365  = ~Yes, it did. Silvanus was pleased that the Black Raven brought a vessel for the spirit of his true servant, and the forest became wet and bountiful again.~
@366  = ~Vessel? Hey, did they also give the grove one of those big caldrons the druids use? You know, those big brassy ones? Very shiny?~
@367  = ~No, you stupid girl! The day I was given to the grove was the last time the Great Druid, Kador the Burner, was seen alive. I took his spirit into myself, that's unmistakable! All signs point to it. I only need to find his scimitar, the Emerald Ray, to prove it!~
@368  = ~So, are you still searching for that sword thing?~
@369  = ~The Emerald Ray is a scimitar, Imoen. It was re-forged by Kador the Burner from the scythe he used to cut mistletoe and other herbs for his potions.~
@370  = ~Must have been some scythe to make the whole scimitar! If I was Kador, I would check to make sure that the blacksmith did not cheat me!~
@371  = ~Kador would never go to a heretic who melts the rocks of the Great Mother into shiny toys for townlings! He called upon Silvanus to reshape the scythe!~
@372  = ~Aha, Silvanus did it. Then there was no cheating, of course. Scythe to scimitar. I wonder what he'd turn Kador's caldron into?~
@373  = ~Hey, Garrick, got any good romance stories? Nothing boring and long, but not a cheap one you'd hear in any tavern.~
@374  = ~Why, of course I do! But I'm, uh, surprised you would ask for such... I'd have thought you'd want to hear tales of epic adventurers, cruel villains or nimble thieves, rather than a sweet romance.~
@375  = ~Yea, well that's all true and such, but I'm still a girl, ya know, and it gets boring hearing the same tales of epic heroes and whatnot over again. Every once-'n-while it's fun to hear a romantic tale.~
@376  = ~I see. Well let me think, then... Ah, I think I've got something that'll fit your request down to a tee!~
@377  = ~*clears his throat* It all began one fine evening in the sleepy town...~
@378  = ~I don't mean to be rude, but why do you hate cities and towns so much? Yeah, I know you're a druid, but us humans and others gotta live somewhere, ya know.~
@379  = ~It is not the fact that humans build towns and cities, but rather the manner in which they do so. Most humans construct their villages with little, if any, regard for the destruction of nature.~
@380  = ~Yea, I guess you got a point there, but what can we do about that?~
@381  = ~Well, you can start by-~
@382  = ~*waving her hand dismissingly* Later, when we get to an inn. I'm hungry and want to take a warm bath.~
@383  = ~Heya, Khalid, I've been meanin' to ask you something.~
@384  = ~Then you may ask it. B-but your "Imoen the Innocent" act needs work. It doesn't inspire t-trust yet.~
@385  = ~Hey, that's not nice. All I wanted to do was ask you about yourself. You know, whatcha like to do when not adventuring, your favorite foods, about what you do in the Harpers, and what kind of animals you like. You know, that kinda thing.~
@386  = ~*sighs* D-do I really seem that foolish? Very well. What about the Harpers?~
@387  = ~Ahh, nothing much, just curious as to what's going on and that sorta thing. Nothing too deep. I don't wanna pry.~
@388  = ~I can answer you that. I d-don't know. Jaheira and I generally get asked things. We aren't t-told the reasons for the questions.~
@389  = ~Oh come on, it'll be a secret. You can trust me.~
@390  = ~What's this? What secret are you talking about?~
@391  = ~Oh, um, nothin' really. I was just asking Khalid here what kinda present you like, so I could get one for your birthday.~
@392  = ~So, Khalid, you busy?~
@393  = ~I s-suppose not. What do you want to talk about?~
@394  = ~Oh, I was just wonderin' what Elminster was like?~
@395  = ~Why are you asking me?~
@396  = ~Well you are a Harper, you know, so I thought you'd be able to tell what he's like. You know, what his favorite story is, where he likes to spend his time vacationing, his favorite food. You know, stuff like that.~
@397  = ~I've been to B-baldur's Gate, too. Do you therefore d-deduce that I'm a drinking partner of the G-grand Dukes?~
@398  = ~Hmm. You know him *that* well, huh?~
@399  = ~I'm afraid so. That *is* the way the world actually works.~
@400  = ~Really? And here I was thinking you were the most worldly man in the Sword Coast. Well, besides Elminster. *sighs* Oh, well. I guess you'll have to become famous yourself. Then I can claim I know *you*.~
@401  = ~Ya know? I think Deheriana was really lucky to know someone like you.~
@402  = ~Lucky? I lead her away from the safety of Shilmista, Imoen, overconfident young fool as I was then! I lead her, mela en' coiamin... the love of my life, to her death. It was my love that gave her to the torturers alive, it was my love that doomed her...~
@403  = ~I'm still thinking that she feels that way. I mean I'd sure like it if I knew someone I cared about would go to any lengths to get whoever killed me.~
@404  = ~You know nothing, Imoen! Do not wish for anyone to prove his love for you in such a way, just wish for love itself - without obstacles, partings or doubts.~
@405  = ~Well, it's hard to know 'bout someone's feelings if there's no proof, ya know? I mean one can go like forever and never notice!~
@406  = ~Fear not, you will know when the time comes.~
@407  = ~Perhaps, my guess is too bold, but I think you know already of a man whose breath catches in his throat when he sees your smile.~
@408  = ~Huh? Who's that?~
@409  = ~I can tell you, but it will spoil the beauty of the foreboding for you. Just listen carefully, child, and you might hear the heart that beats as one with your own.~
@410  = ~Why do you always keep counting your gold, every time we stop for a rest? Do you really expect us to steal it?~
@411  = ~Never hurts to check up on your money. 'Specially when there be a thief in the party.~
@412  = ~What!? Hey, that's not very nice. I don't steal stuff from my own comrades!~
@413  = ~Wasn't <CHARNAME>'s left boot missing the other morning?~
@414  = ~Yea, but that's just between me and <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@415  = ~And the other day, when ya was avoiding Jaheira after she lost her necklace.~
@416  = ~Well, um... you see... Jaheira told me that I am too unexperienced, and I-~
@417  = ~And the time Edwin yelled off all of our ears after having one of his scrolls go missing.~
@418  = ~So it was the little brat after all.~
@419  = ~What about the time ya did sneak out that wand the witch's pack and was trying to hide it?~
@420  = ~I didst know that it was Imoen's doing, and we have talked about this matter in great detail already.~
@421  = ~Anyway, that kinda stuff was all just pranks. You can't seriously think that I would steal for any malicious purpose!~
@422  = ~I still don't have my scroll back, but now I know where to look and who to check first next time.~
@423  = ~Pranks or no, I keeps a close eye on me gold.~
@424  = ~Hey, Minsc, have you ever thought of changing Boo's color? Well, kind of like they turn clothing and hair and such into all sorts of different colors? Boo, wouldn't you look cute with your fur in a nice pink?~
@425  = ~Boo wouldn't be Boo, then.~
@426  = ~He would be the same person, err... hamster, Minsc, he would just... hmmm... change his look?~
@427  = ~What's that, Boo? Oh, Boo says that it's not in his character to go for a dramatic remake.~
@428  = ~Oh, well. If he changes his mind, I'll be shopping for more hair dye soon enough, so just whistle! I'd help him to select something... something heroic.~
@429  = ~Erm... Boo says: of course we would whistle!~
@430  = ~Hey, Minsc, I, um would like to ask you something if you're not too busy.~
@431  = ~Minsc, busy? Never, except while doing some butt-kicking of evil doers! And feeding Boo.~
@432  = ~Okay, whatever. So you're not all that busy, then. Well, I've been meaning to ask you about this Dynaheir. What is she like?~
@433  = ~Dynaheir is Minsc and Boo's witch. Together we must protect her, but, alas, I did fail. At least, now I have a chance to redeem myself.~
@434  = ~Yea, but that's not what I wanted to know exactly. I was wanting to know what kinda person she was.~
@435  = ~Oh, Minsc did not understand your question.~
@436  = ~Dynaheir is a very strong woman. She is also very smart, sometimes Boo thinks she has ideas that even he never thought of. Dynaheir is also a very good person, else Minsc would not attempt to guard her so well, isn't that right, Boo?~
@437  = ~*Squeak*~ [GAM_48]
@438  = ~But you, little one, should wait to meet her yourself. I know she'll like you.~
@439  = ~Hey, Minsc, what does Boo like to eat, exactly?~
@440  = ~Boo eats nuts, grains and berries mostly. They keep him strong, quick and smart, but he also loves to eat cheese. Cheese is his favorite.~
@441  = ~Really? Well, I think I got a piece of cheese I can give him. *Imoen searches her pack, breaks off a small piece of cheese and hands it to Minsc.*~
@442  = ~Boo will be quite pleased with this! I will make sure he knows you gave him this special treat.~
@443  = ~What do you mean, you'll make sure? Where is he?~
@444  = ~Boo is resting. He had a long night.~
@445  = ~How can ya act so cruelly, Monatron? Aren't halflings s'pose ta be fun-loving thieves and adventurers or more homely types?~
@446  = ~Pfeh! I likes me fun well enow - inna right time 'n' place. This here ain't them, though, nor are ya lot the comp'ny I'd choose fer it. Take yerself, girlie. Do ya preefurr us little folk t' bow low afore ya - so ya kin step on our necks 'thout liftin' yer knees quite so painful high?~
@447  = ~Eh? What d'ya mean?~
@448  = ~'Tis what my folk'd say o' *ya* - assumin' yer a 'typ'cal' big un.~
@449  = ~Typical? I guess I never thought 'bout that.~
@450  = ~Heh! I knowed *that*. Just stick t' dippin' 'n' yer no-thinkin'; leave me onna down 'n' dirty side as yer too dainty fer. No sense worritin' 'bout how no *other* big or little folk'd fare out here, right?~
@451  = ~*rubs her head* I think we can leave it at that. I'm still not convinced, but I'm gettin' a headache trying ta follow yer reasoning.~
@452  = ~I can't believe you still look so good after all those battles. How d'you do it?~
@453  = ~Why, thank you. It's not always easy, but a woman must always think beyond the immediate heat of battle towards long-term gain.~
@454  = ~Are you starting to take an interest in such things, dear? It must have been dull and difficult growing up with just a bunch of bookish old men, without a positive female influence.~
@455  = ~Nah, it wasn't bad. They let us do whatever we wanted - well, mostly. And, when I was bored enough, there was some interestin' stuff about adventures in a few of those books. *sighs* Wouldn't let me in to see the ones with the good magical stuff, though.~
@456  = ~Well, magic can be a dangerous thing, especially for youngsters. But look at you now! You're having your own adventure. It's wonderful, darling, that you're living your dreams - I've seen many a woman who never even knew what it was to dream, let alone seizing a chance to fulfill them the way you have.~
@457  = ~So, Shar-Teel, why do you keep staying with us? I'd have thought you'd take the first night to stab <CHARNAME> while he sleeps, since he's a male and all.~
@458  = ~What do you know, you bubbling excuse for a woman? I told him I would repay my debt since I lost and that's it. End of story.~
@459  = ~I suppose, but I thought you didn't hold to this honor stuff, especially with males.~
@460  = ~Wait, maybe there is some decency in you! Or could it be perhaps that you have feelings for <CHARNAME>?~
@461  = ~I would suggest you stop this line of thought now, before you find yourself with a dagger through your throat. Or I will cut your tongue, so that it is forked as befits a snake's. Some women *spits* are little better than men.~
@462  = ~Listen, I need to talk to you, one-on-one.~
@463  = ~Yes, of course, what is it?~
@464  = ~I don't want to hurt your feelings, but Eldoth isn't the guy for you.~
@465  = ~You, too? I thought at least you might be able to see beyond what the others do.~
@466  = ~You are joking, right? Imoen, this isn't funny, you know.~
@467  = ~*shaking her head* I'm sorry, but he said his love for you was just a youngster's infatuation.~
@468  = ~No! You're lying! He would never say something like that!~
@469  = ~Leave me alone! Leave me alone, you... trollop!~
@470  = ~Erm... Skie, about what I said about Eldoth the other day...~
@471  = ~Oh, no need to worry. I asked Eldoth about that, and he said he was just jesting with you. *laughs* No need to worry.~
@472  = ~And you believe what he told you?~
@473  = ~Of course! Eldoth'd never lie to me like that!~
@474  = ~You sure? What if the whole thing with you is just a ruse?~
@475  = ~No, wait! I'm not saying it is, he really could love you, but have you thought about what might happen if you're wrong?~
@476  = ~I-I don't have to think about it. I know that Eldoth loves me!~
@477  = ~Please, Imoen, please drop this. I'd like someone else here to talk to, who won't continuously urge me to break up with Eldoth.~
@478  = ~*sighs* Right.~
@479  = ~*smiles brightly* So, did you see what <CHARNAME> did yesterday morning?~
@480  = ~Here ya go. It's another one of our tasteless rations. *hands Skie some dried beef rations*~
@481  = ~Ugh. Not again. Why can't we bring more variety with us? I mean, even on the merchant caravans I heard they have better food than this.~
@482  = ~Yea, but they also know when and where they'll usually be the next day. So, unless you wanna eat moldy bread or rotten tomatoes, don't complain. Besides, it's not like we have to eat this every day. I mean, yesterday we had the dried fish.~
@483  = ~TIAX! Behind you! It's Cyric! Your moment of glory has arrived!~
@484  = ~What!?! Where!?! ~
@485  = ~Ha ha! Made you look!~
@486  = ~Tiax's destiny will not be mocked by this whelp! A day on the rack for you when Tiax rules! Tiax KNEW you were lying from the start, anyway. When Cyric arrives, Tiax will know, for Cyric shall carve a path of blood and destruction through all of Tiax's enemies before finally placing the crown of rule upon Tiax's awaiting head! All will tremble with fear and beg for their...~
@487  = ~Tiax!!! Look overhead!!! CYRIC HAS ARRIVED!!!~
@488  = ~What!?! Where!?!~
@489  = ~Ha ha! Made you look again! I could keep this up all day!~
@490  = ~TTiiiiiiax!!!!~
@491  = ~You shall refer to Tiax as "The Great Tiax" from now on! The mighty Tiax will let you go this time, but next time you wouldn't be so lucky!~
@492  = ~Yeah... so, "mighty Tiax", when you rule the world what will you make me?~
@493  = ~Eh? You? The great Tiax has to think on this.~
@494  = ~...Tiax thinks that you would make a fine scout in his grand army! You should be honored that you could assist and perhaps even die for Tiax!~
@495  = ~Riiight... we'll... talk later, huh?~
@496  = ~Don't mean to pry, but why do you keep watching me and <CHARNAME>, when we're talkin' ta each other?~
@497  = ~You noticed me? I thought I hid it better than that. I'll not deny it, though, since you might be able to give me an answer to something that's been bothering me.~
@498  = ~Guess so, though I dunno how much help I can be.~
@499  = ~Why do you let your guard down so much when you're with <CHARNAME>?~
@500  = ~Whatcha mean by that?~
@501  = ~You joke around with <PRO_HIMHER>, confide your feelings and beliefs in <PRO_HIMHER>. Never would one I knew in the Underdark do such a thing.~
@502  = ~Really? Never? All these crusty books didn't mention much 'bout drow customs, but that seems kinda far fetched.~
@503  = ~Why is that? You make yourself an easy target, if <CHARNAME> ever decides to betray you.~
@504  = ~I've known <PRO_HIMHER> for quite some time. <PRO_HESHE> might do many things I don't care for, especially being too goody-goody when it comes to my activities, but betraying a friend isn't one of 'em.~
@505  = ~I've known <PRO_HIMHER> for quite some time. <PRO_HESHE> might do many things I don't care for, but betraying a friend isn't one of 'em.~
@506  = ~I've known <PRO_HIMHER> for quite some time. I doub't <PRO_HESHE>'d go and betray me, even if <PRO_HESHE> can sometimes be devious. 'Sides, even if <PRO_HESHE> did, I know how to handle it.~
@507  = ~You don't not get to know a person after spendin' years with 'em. Even if they're as closed as whatcha say you Drow are like. You can't tell me you didn't learn anythin' about people you saw quite often.~
@508  = ~There is some truth to what you say, but to be so free and open!? In the Underdark, even if I worked alongside another for my entire life, I'd never do such a thing! *rubs her forehead* It's giving me a headache while even trying to understand your reasoning.~
@509  = ~Don't worry, it'll come to you. 'Sides, no one said I let <CHARNAME> know everything.~
@510  = ~Hey, Xzar! Wanna jelly drop?~
@511  = ~Why, I... why do you offer me such a confection?~
@512  = ~Uh... because you asked for it?~
@513  = ~Hmmm. Let's have a look... AHA! Assassin as well as thief! But I see through your cunning little plot!~
@514  = ~What are you talking about? They're good! Watch, I'll eat one first.~
@515  = ~Any fool knows that *proper* jelly drops are red! *You* ate a red one, leaving the poisonous green and yellow ones for me!~
@516  = ~Sheesh! Tell ya what. Pick out one green and one yellow and *I'll* eat them - just to prove they're ok.~
@517  = ~You would do that? Then there is no need. But they ought to be poisonous with those colors. Besides, they look so naked without their shells.~
@518  = ~Look! I got these for ya! You can have just the red ones if you want. Now. Do you want a damn jelly drop or not?~
@519  = ~No. I would like to be able to want one, but I find that I do not. They are too nearly alive to be enticing.~
@520  = ~What do ya think, <CHARNAME>?~
@521  = ~Yea, I think I'll join you, guys. We got plenty of money to spare.~
@522  = ~Sorry, but we're on a tight budget, so its only the basics for us.~
@523  = ~Sorry, but getting better weapons and armor comes first, unless you want to die in the next battle.~
@524  = ~Heh. See, even <CHARNAME> agrees with me.~
@525  = ~Heh. See even <CHARNAME> agrees with me. *turns toward <CHARNAME>* But you're not joining us, while we bathe.~
@526  = ~Tightwad!~
@527  = ~Don't worry. As long as I'm around, you don't have to count coppers. We can have a good night out and use the rest for equipment.~
@528  = ~Indeed!~
@529  = ~Yes, that sounds like a good idea! I'm sure there will be plenty left over...~
@530  = ~Yes, what knowledge can I bestow upon you today?~
@531  = ~Hold still for a second. *measures Quayle's nose with a ruler*~
@532  = ~Yep! I thought so!~
@533  = ~What? Why did you stick that object up my nose!? Do you not have any respect for those of superior intellect?~
@534  = ~Well, um, that's beside the point. I needed to find something out, and I did.~
@535  = ~What's that? What could someone of your abilities possibly want to know about my nose that I haven't already explained?~
@536  = ~Oh, nothing much. Just that your nose is of an average size for a gnome.~
@537  = ~WHAT!? How dare you make such a statement! Why, I'll have you know I've been complimented by many about the size of my nose. It is the pinnacle of perfection. Why, I was actually offered an award back home for it, though I declined it out of modesty. I didn't want to leave all the other gnomes feeling inferior, you see.~
@538  = ~You may be right. Let me check again. *measures Quayle's nose again*~
@539  = ~Yep, you're right, your nose isn't average.~
@540  = ~Told you so! Now I expect an apology.~
@541  = ~Oh, no. It's not average, it's below average.~
@542  = ~WHAT!? Give me that book! I want to see what heretical imbecile wrote that awful piece of work! ANY gnome of ANY stature would know that a nose of my size is quite exceptionally large. *Grabs the book from Imoen's hands and begins to read it.*~
@543  = ~*not waiting for Quayle to read it* Well, this particular book is entitled, "A Brief Compendium of Gnomish Physiology". It seems to depict a lot about gnomish body parts and other stuff like age, birth and stuff. Quite boring, but the author, Kenudrum Galador, seems to have written many books here. I've even seen a few biographies, so I figure he's someone important.~
@544  = ~I-I - This book was obviously translated into Common tongue quite poorly. And look at its age! The original copy predates the Time of Troubles!~
@545  = ~Yea, but this particular one was signed by a gnomish Chief Peduritan Morninglight.~
@546  = ~*Imoen claps her hands together with a mock look of surprise and understanding on her face.* Oh, and I think, if I remember correctly, the Morninglights have ruled High Haspur for centuries now. (I guess it was a good idea to pay attention to my studies once in a while.) I did a little research, and he was still around until a century or so ago, fairly well respected too, at least among gnomes, from what I hear. And this translation and update was signed by him. *Imoen points out that it is updated.*~
@547  = ~I'm sure you're not saying that the late Chief Peduritan Morninglight wasn't as well versed as you.~
@548  = ~Well no, I'm not. It's just he probably didn't read it very closely at all. Chief Peduritan was quite a busy gnome, you know. He probably wouldn't have had the time.~
@549  = ~Really? This copy was personally signed by him, *flips to the first page* and you'd think of all the things he'd be particular on, it would be to make sure the average size of a gnome's nose was correct?~
@550  = ~Well, I suppose so, but...~
@551  = ~I still think Quayle's nose is quite broad. Much larger than anything I have seen previously.~
@552  = ~Well, Quayle's a gnome, Skie, not a human. Gnomes have broader noses than humans.~
@553  = ~I guess you're right. *touches her own nose* I... I wonder if there is a mirror somewhere?~
@554  = ~No worries! Boo still likes you. He thinks that your nose is cute, for a gnome's that is. Here, you can pet Boo, if you want. He'll make you feel better.~
@555  = ~Cute!? My nose is definitely not 'cute'!~
@556  = ~What's that? Oh, yea, I guess you're right. Boo says he was comparing it to the other gnomes he'd met. It's definitely not as cute as a hamster's nose.~
@557  = ~Just a suggestion, Quayle. You'd best drop it before she starts commenting on how small your head is.~
@558  = ~MY HEAD IS SMALL? Whatever do you mean? My head holds my enormous brain, so it is large!~
@559  = ~Well, maybe in comparison to your nose, but if that's below average...~
@560  = ~Oh, Master Quayle, she fancies you, on my honor as a thief! How many human maidens have you seen take interest in a gnome's nose? Congratulations! She is quite a prize, if you go for the giggly type.~
@561  = ~*sweatdrop*~
@562  = ~Hmm, so if Quayle's nose isn't up to par, I wonder what else could be? Care to lend me that book, Imoen?~
@563  = ~Well, I guess so, but I gotta give it back. I sorta borrowed it... *whistles innocently*~
@564  = ~Hmm, I wonder what else about you might be below the norm, gnome.~
@565  = ~Tee-hee. Don't worry, Quayle, I'll keep it a secret. *giggles* Maybe.~
@566  = ~Don't ya be frettin' now. I can always stretch that nose of yers, fer a price.~
@567  = ~*covers his nose* I would never degrade myself to artificially stretching my nose, especially by a dwarf.~
@568  = ~Careful there... or I may 'cide ta be stetchin' other parts of yer body. Free o' charge...~
@569  = ~He-he.~
@570  = ~Imoen has beat you, Quayle. You should give up, while you still have some dignity left.~
@571  = ~About time someone put you into place, Quayle! I always thought your nose was a bit small!~
@572  = ~Let me see that book, Imoen...~
@573  = ~Imoen, stop this. I will not allow my friends to be mocked so cruelly.~
@574  = ~Cut this nonsense out, all of you. It is not the best time for fooling around.~
@575  = ~Oh, so you wanna continue? I'm sure I can find other deficiencies... lets look up the size of gnomish heads...~
@576  = ~Huh? Whatcha talking about? *backs up slowly with the book behind her*~
@577  = ~Something a problem? Why're you backing off like that?~
@578  = ~Oh well. Nevermind.~
@579  = ~Then you won't mind showing me the book, will you?~
@580  = ~N-no reason in particular... *Imoen lets the book drop into a pile of muddy water.* Oops, sorry. *quickly grabs it* I, uh, have to bring this back before the book gets waterlogged... Talk to ya later!~
@581  = ~Okay, sure. *Imoen holds out the book and lets it drop into a pile of muddy water just before <CHARNAME> grabs it.* Oops, sorry! *quickly grabs it* I, uh, have to bring this back before the book gets waterlogged... See ya later!~
@582  = ~Fine. Here. *Imoen reluctantly hands the book over.*~
@583  = ~Hmm. I suggest you return this book to Sage Bunter, before he starts tearing through the whole city.~
@584  = ~Oh, good. Now, let us go.~
@585  = ~Yeah, I promise, I will.~
@586  = ~And the other scrolls, as well. I'm sure they'll be quite upset, should those go missing.~
@587  = ~How'd you-?~
@588  = ~You never change.~
@589  = ~*roll your eyes* Let us go, little thief.~
@590  = ~Because you have the most annoying habit of stealing *everything* you see.~
@591  = ~But, but...~
@592  = ~I can't believe it! Here I am giving my intellect to you, lesser people, out of the goodness of my heart, and this is the thanks I get? I think it's best I go elsewhere, to where my intellect will be more appreciated!~
@593  = ~Hey, Xan, you gotta minute?~
@594  = ~I suppose. The lady whom I had an appointment with is fashionably late. I wonder what keeps her?~
@595  = ~Erm? Anyone I know?~
@596  = ~We all will be introduced to her very soon. The name is Death.~
@597  = ~None of us should be seeing her for a while, hopefully. Yea, I know you're a big grump and all, but I got the perfect thing to cure you of your continuous depressive mood.~
@598  = ~*sighs*~
@599  = ~That's what you think. Anyway, wanna hear 'bout my idea?~
@600  = ~I have seen your like before. If I say: "No", which is my uttermost desire, you shall ask: "Why?", and you shall continue pestering me until my very end. I would love to spend my last moments in peace, so spit it out and remember that brevity is-~
@601  = ~Great! Now listen, cuz I know you'll be glad when this works, and you can let everyone know it was Imoen who cured you.~
@602  = ~Here it is: I'm going to dress you all in bright colors, especially in a lot of pink. We can even dye your hair pink if that'll help, paint your fingernails pink, anything to get you over this "life's not worth living" attitude!~
@603  = ~*looks at Imoen's bright cheerful smile dubiously* I doubt that will work. All it will do is waste your time, money and effort you could better spend preparing for our eventual demise.~
@604  = ~That's what you think! Just you wait. I know it'll make you all perky and cheerful, just like me!~
@605  = ~*aside* Pesky and earful, more like...~
@606  = ~Yea, I think this'll be a good place to try it. Hey, Xan, come here. I need you for a second.~
@607  = ~What is it this time? Can't you see I'm trying to be alone? The bustle of the city makes me feel insignificant.~ [%tutu_var%XANNN13]
@608  = ~Hmm, no, that looks too drab, but the other one doesn't go with his eyes. Hmm, maybe if I did this... No, that's not it. Oh, sorry there. Did you say something?~
@609  = ~What ill-omened scheme are you up to now!?~
@610  = ~Ill-omened!? What do you take me for, some evil witch or something?~
@611  = ~Remember how I said, I'd cure you of your depression? Well, guess what? You're going to be getting a new outfit! Yep, all courtesy of me. No, don't thank me, it's my duty to get you out of the slums you're in.~
@612  = ~Well, I think the tailor can weave some of this purple in with the pink and the white outline. *starts peeling off some of Xan's outfit*~
@613  = ~We'll need to get your hair dyed pink with a stripe of yellow, maybe. Of course, your nails will have to be done in pink as well, though maybe light blue... for a clash with your new robes, to help highlight them. We can try both!~
@614  = ~Some jewelry would be nice also. Earrings sound fine, but men usually don't wear more than two of 'em, so I'll ask one of the elven merchants which is best, but make sure it has a good amount of pink and gold.~
@615  = ~And, of course, we can't forget to add some necklaces and rings and bracelets. Not enough to look like some god-awful snotty nosed rich person, (I can't stand them) but just enough to brighten up those dreary looks of yours. I'll have to do some research, cuz I don't know that many pink stones. I'm sure there are some, but if not some glass baubles will work decently enough.~
@616  = ~There are plenty of pink stones, Imoen. Why, there are pink garnets, lals, the color of roses and pink vorobevstones, which I may say are just like m'lady's cheeks when she blushes... and pink topazes of course... some rubystones are pink and bright carnelian. My kin from Lantan trade corals sometimes, aside from the most peculiar sort of items.~
@617  = ~Many gemstones have the maiden's blush to 'em - or so my kin calls it. Take ya quartz fer one, it can be pink, or any shade of color for that matter. Even diamonds does - spoils its price, it does. 'Em eastern tourmalines comes of any color ya may wish and oft pink.~
@618  = ~I like my outfit just the way it is. *attempts to backup slowly in alarm, but Imoen grabs at him* Besides... besides, there is no such thing as Pinkcloaks of Evereska...~
@619  = ~Course then we'll need to do your shoes. The ones you have will clash horribly with your new outfit. And then maybe change some of your personal items. I mean your backpack is dreary... A little color here...~

@621  = ~Give him back his stuff, Imoen. He's been even more annoying since you played dress-up with him.~
@622  = ~Imoen! This... this mockery is to stop right this minute! Xan was noble enough to have played your silly dress-up game, but now it's over. Wipe this stupid grin off your face and give him his clothes back. NOW!~
@623  = ~Give him back his stuff, Imoen. It's his life: if he wants to live depressed about dying, it's his choice.~
@624  = ~I'm with Imoen here. You don't seem to have gotten over your attitude, yet.~
@625  = ~Imoen does have a point. And besides, it's just clothing. Remember it's all in the way you view it that will determine the way you die, not what you wear.~
@626  = ~Obviously, since you're still wearing them, you don't care enough to go and buy another set. See, your fingernails are even still painted.~
@627  = ~I don't care what happens. Just figure something out betwixt yourselves.~
@628  = ~Spoilsport. *sticks her tongue out at <CHARNAME>*~
@629  = ~Well, since you keep insisting on trying to change them, I have no choice but to keep it up. Besides, you don't want torn robes, tangled hair or chipped nails, do you?~
@630  = ~Since you keep complaining about the doomed cause we're in, does it matter how you dress?~
@631  = ~Hey! That's not the way you're supposed to look at it! Now I'm gonna have to redouble my efforts!~
@632  = ~Well, I guess Xan at least cares about *something*, so I'll let him have his old outfit and stuff back. The hair and nails will take some time to return to normal. Xan, don't think I'm done with you, though. I've got other ideas up my sleeve!~
@633  = ~You're still not up to snuff, yet! We're making progress, though! At least you care about what you look like. See, I knew this plan would work!~
@634  = ~Well, anyway, you see I'm not alone, so you'll still have to wear 'em, cuz you're still being a sour apple, otherwise you'd never have brought this up.~
@635  = ~Really? I can do you next time if you want. It's no problem for me, in fact it's quite fun, actually.~
@636  = ~Umm, no thanks, Imoen. I was just kidding.~
@637  = ~Umm, no thanks, Imoen. It's not the same, once someone else has had it happen to him.~
@638  = ~Sure! I'd love to do that!~
@639  = ~Really? That sucks. Well, I guess can always come up with a new idea. It'll take a while though.~
@640  = ~Take your time, no need to rush it.~
@641  = ~Alrighty! I'll have to do some work, as you're obviously a different person than Xan here, so it'll take some time.~
@642  = ~*waves her hand dismissively* Look at me, here. I can come up with something for you if you want like I did for Xan!~
@643  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I missed my clothes... Wait! I'm *still* missing... some... rather personal items. Imoen? Come back here!~
@644  = ~What? But Imoen has confessed in stealing from me... and still you side with her? I can't believe this! *sighs* Well, I guess I can. Honor is a rare commodity in this day and age. If I cannot recover my rightful belongings, I shall at least leave the company of the thieves who took them.~
@645  = ~Whatever you may say... but would you be willing to prove your point by wearing this... motley cloth?~
@646  = ~Of course! But I am a woman, who feels beautiful whether dressed in a sack, motley clothes, ball gown or in just her own skin. I am afraid that I am a bad advisor here, Xan.~
@647  = ~Definitely, I wish Imoen had done the same for me.~
@648  = ~I wouldn't mind, but it's hard to sneak in shadows and hide with such bright colors.~
@649  = ~I don't care how my clothing looks, just so long the cut is practical.~
@650  = ~You wouldn't catch me dead or alive in those colors!~
@651  = ~*sighs* It is hopeless. Corellon knows I did try, despite my foreboding that it will be just as useless as all we do. She keeps stealing from me, and she has apparently discovered some odd enchantment that returns my hair and nails to this gaudy color whilst I sleep... and it has nothing to do with illusions, I am sure of that. Necromancy, perhaps, or some twisted form of conjuration.~
@652  = ~Indeed, what little solace it would bring me. Alas, I think it is time for me to leave this party. Then, at least, I will have a slight chance to die with a shred of dignity, which I am surely denied here.~
@653  = ~So you agree that wearing my own clothes is a doomed cause as well. At least our company is consistent in choosing to fight lost causes.~
@654  = ~*sighs* Yet another lost cause to fight...~
