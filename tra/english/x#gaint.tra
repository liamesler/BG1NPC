@0    = ~I've heard many great things about this carnival - said to be the finest across all the Sword Coast! I hope we'll have at least a little time to relax...~
@1    = ~Garrick, every salesman claims his own product to be the best. It's probably just mediocre.~
@2    = ~I'm sure there's time for recreation here.~
@3    = ~Bah! I'm above such pithy amusements as this pathetic carnival. I'm not a child.~
@4    = ~Oh, well, uh... I mean, we could at least give it a go. Ah well.~
@5    = ~I can tell we're going to get along fabul... fab... ah, brilliantly, <CHARNAME>!~
@6    = ~The Firewine Bridge... Surely a tale or two to be, uh, told around these parts!~
@7    = ~Though, I do wonder where the river actually *is*...~
@8    = ~Hmmm. I guess such things are perhaps not for man to know.~
@9    = ~Hey, guys, wait up!~
@10   = ~The city of Baldur's Gate... So much to do, so much to see! We could perhaps see a play, visit the Hall of Wonders...~
@11   = ~We've hardly got time for such trivialities, Garrick. Keep quiet.~
@12   = ~I've never been here before. Where do you suggest we visit?~
@13   = ~Art and history isn't trivial, it is... uh... Bah!~
@14   = ~Oh, so many places! We could visit Gond's Hall of Wonders across town, the Duchal Palace, the-~
@15   = ~I get the picture. We'll take a look as we wander, then.~
@16   = ~My ears can't take this punishment any more! Keep your mouth shut. I decide where we go.~
@17   = ~I meant more along the lines of taverns and supplies...~
@18   = ~Well, there's quite a few arms merchants about town, but for magical wares we're best off trying Sorcerous Sundries not too far from here. The owner's a bit, uh, aloof at times, though...~
@19   = ~For taverns, I'd suggest the Elfsong or, ah, the Blushing Mermaid. But I'm not sure if you like the same places as me, and, well, there's loads to choose from.~
@20   = ~Thanks, Garrick. I'll bear that in mind.~
@21   = ~So this is the inside of the famous Keep? Wow, there's more books than you could read in, ah, a dozen lifetimes!~
@22   = ~Yes, that's why they call it a library.~
@23   = ~They're mostly very dry historical accounts and obscure spell tomes, Garrick. You probably wouldn't find them very interesting.~
@24   = ~We don't have time, Garrick, we've got to find the Iron Throne leaders!~
@25   = ~Well, no need for *that* sort of attitude <CHARNAME>. Some of us weren't so fortunate as to grow up surrounded by legends of lore...~
@26   = ~I suppose it was quite a privilege, Garrick. Anyhow, let's go; we've not much time to waste. We've got to find the Iron Throne leaders!~
@27   = ~And we don't wish to waste the rest of our lives around them, either. Come on, we've got things to do.~
@28   = ~Oh, no! I find all books interesting, <CHARNAME>... You never know when something you read will unexpectedly turn out to be of vital importance!~
@29   = ~At least, uh, that's what I tell myself.~
@30   = ~Perhaps we'll find time later, but for now we'd best be moving.~
@31   = ~Great attitude, but we have no time to talk about books, Garrick. We've got to find the Iron Throne leaders!~
@32   = ~I'll be glad when this is all over. I hope it's not going to be too messy...~
@33   = ~Well, not too much has changed, then. Now she just waits until we make camp, before she gets away from the rest of the party and... Ah... uhmm... forget I said that.~
@34   = ~I heard that, Garrick. Watch your tongue while talking of the fairer gender, especially lady <CHARNAME>!~
@35   = ~Aha, so your little friends here noticed it, too?~
@36   = ~Such a terrible thing, to see a creature of such beauty wasting away...~
@37   = ~A hero's work is never done.~
@38   = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, we must!~
@39   = ~I have heard many a tale of poor fellows subdued by evil enchantments, but to hear of one happening now is terrible! <CHARNAME> we must help!~
@40   = ~To boldly go where others dare not... ‘Tis the adventurer's creed!~
@41   = ~What sorcery is this? He... He's talking to them! The man is mad!~
@42   = ~The inside of the Ducal Palace. Magnificent! If only we were here in happier times.~
@43   = ~Oh, I guess I should be, ah, paying attention...~
@44   = ~Self–flagellation? Oh, my...~
@45   = ~He's right, <CHARNAME>. Kelddath is the High Priest of Lathander in this region.~
@46   = ~Such a sad tale. To arms, then!~
@47   = ~Uh, okay.~
@48   = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, we shouldn't! I have been involved with those who break the law before, and ‘tis not the right path!~
@49   = ~It is surely a little bit naughty, but... but think about it as finding a better home for the artifact... yes, yes, very noble goal.~
@50   = ~Cadderly? As in *the* Cadderly, famed priest of Deneir?~
@51   = ~I wouldn't quite say ‘famed', but yes, that is I.~
@52   = ~I can't see the wood for the subterranean trees...~
@53   = ~This is Duke Eltan, <CHARNAME>. I have heard good things about him; I think we should tell him the truth.~
@54   = ~Indeed, that would be in your own interests.~
@55   = ~Kozah was an ancient deity of desruction. We should be careful!~
@56   = ~I don't recognise the language, but Kozah was an old god of chaos and destruction... I don't like the sound of that!~
@57   = ~The famed ranger, Drizzt Do'Urden!~
@58   = ~Indeed, and well met, young man! Will you aid me?~
@59   = ~Drizzt is a noble warrior, <CHARNAME>. We must help him!~
@60   = ~An Ogre mage? We must flee, <CHARNAME>! We cannot stand against a creature like this!~
@61   = ~Such beauty! We cannot allow this affront to nature!~
@62   = ~You speak truth, even if you are dressed like a city-dweller.~
@63   = ~The warrior true, fighting to save his lady... Now that their quest is over, <CHARNAME>, perhaps they could join ours?~
@64   = ~I would indeed be honored to serve thee, <CHARNAME>~
@65   = ~<CHARNAME>, let's go! I came here once, as a child, and there are some truly terrific sights...~
@66   = ~We have splendid, splendid new acquisitions, too, sir!~
@67   = ~<CHARNAME>, let's go! I came here once, as a child, and there are some truly terrific sights...~
@68   = ~I'm so excited!~
@69   = ~A Steam Dragon! What will they think of next?~
@70   = ~This high and mighty wizard seems an arrogant type indeed, and those red robes hint at a Thayvian... We should be careful of our dealings with him, <CHARNAME>.~
@71   = ~This high and mighty wizard seems an arrogant type indeed, and those red robes hint at a Thayvian... We should be careful of our dealings with him, <CHARNAME>.~
@72   = ~Extortion? Blackmail? Those don't sound like very noble goals.~
@73   = ~Hmm, child, you said something?~
@74   = ~Child?!? I-~
@75   = ~I do assure you it pains me to do this, but you must think of my lover, Skie! This is the only way she can escape the tyranny of her life. So, what do you say?~
@76   = ~Elminster of Shadowdale, famed sage and Chosen of Mystra? Could it be?~
@77   = ~Aye, one and the same. I can tell ye have the glint of a story–spinner in those young eyes, lad. Why don't ye tell me your name that I might say in the future I know the biographer of <CHARNAME>?~
@78   = ~I am, uh... Oh, my, Elminster himself!~
@79   = ~Nay, I'm Elminster.~
@80   = ~I mean, ah, my name is Garrick, sir. And it's an honor to meet you.~
@81   = ~Garrick? I'll keep thy name and face in my head, lad. I expect great things of thee. But now, I must address that which is weighing down the mind of <CHARNAME>.~
@82   = ~And greetings again, Garrick.~
@83   = ~Tis an honor to see you again, sir.~
@84   = ~I'm beginning to see how you've acquired a reputation for, uh, interference... In the best possible sense of the word, sir!~
@85   = ~That sure would mean pretty big bones...~
@86   = ~Ah, true love! Perhaps we could help Fergus in this matter?~
@87   = ~The History of the Dead Three – he's right, a dark tale indeed. Merely thinking of those fell deities sends shivers down my spine.~
@88   = ~You'd be surprised how travel broadens a bard's horizons, sir.~
@89   = ~Possibly, but I prefer my silken sheets. Good evening to you.~
@90   = ~<CHARNAME>, what price, for innocent life? I say we refuse this Gallor's offer and inform Charleston.~
@91   = ~Clouded prophecy, the stuff of legend, indeed! I must make notes.~
@92   = ~Oh, my.~
@93   = ~Wherever we turn, we find adventure and intrigue... To the Three Old Kegs, <CHARNAME>?~
@94   = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, what's real? Nothing makes any sense!~
@95   = ~We have many a tale to spin; what say you, <CHARNAME>?~
@96   = ~No! This is not right, that man is an artist!~
@97   = ~These are dire portents indeed...~
@98   = ~It seems there's a lot of shady rumours involving the Iron Throne these days...~
@99   = ~Messing with the dead oft causes such suffering for the living...~
@100  = ~Intriguing. That sounds like the beginnings of a grand adventure, eh, <CHARNAME>?~
@101  = ~Oh, I think I can feel my breakfast coming back up!~
@102  = ~Wow, I don't think I've ever heard a gnoll speak before. Perhaps we should check it out?~
@103  = ~A good tale is priceless, <CHARNAME>. And I fear this one, dark as it is, could be important.~
@104  = ~I swear that it's worth every coin ye'd pay me.~
@105  = ~I'd be very careful when dealing with the servants of the Bitch Queen, <CHARNAME>.~
@106  = ~He does, uh, have a point there.~
@107  = ~Surely we can do this simple task for such a sweet lady?~
@108  = ~He's right.~
@109  = ~The rules of Candlekeep are known by all learned fellows, <CHARNAME>. Tis a shame they will not bend, just a little.~
@110  = ~That does sound strange. The Undercellars has a particularly, uh, unsavoury reputation...~
@111  = ~Not that I'd know, of course.~
@112  = ~Well met, friends. I hope you can get to the bottom of this – for all our sakes.~
@113  = ~Amazing! Can such be true?~
@114  = ~A hellish chicken? I've had a hellish stomach after a poorly cooked chicken hotpot, but this man's talk of, uh, talk, ‘tis new to me!~
@115  = ~That's barbaric!~
@116  = ~I prefer the term... depraved, hmmm?~
@117  = ~Baldur's Gate is closed? Surely the situation must be serious, indeed.~
@118  = ~Surely there must be something we can do to help!~
@119  = ~I get the feeling that happens a lot.~
@120  = ~Nosferatu is a classic; but on the other hand an exploding ogre sounds like a lot of fun!~
@121  = ~Wow.~
@122  = ~Meilum? I don't, ah, think so. What about you, <CHARNAME>?~
@123  = ~A talking, uh... chicken? Oh, my. What, ah, fowl sorcery is this?~
@124  = ~Fowl? *cluck* You've no idea how much I'm *cluck* going to hate these paltry jokes when *cluck* I get out of this!~
@125  = ~Hmm. Paltry jokes, or poultry jokes?~
@126  = ~Gaaaaaah! *cluck*~
@127  = ~Wait! I was just joking with a *chicken*? Oh, my, oh, my...~
@128  = ~*cluck*~
@129  = ~If you ask me, you're pretty lucky not to be a roast chicken!~
@130  = ~To arms, then! We shall prevail!~
@131  = ~That's monstrous!~
@132  = ~A shame. We might've learned something!~
@133  = ~What a vile creature! He deserves to rot in these cells!~
@134  = ~Vile or no, heh, I'm your only way out of here...~
@135  = ~Xzar's reports? What?~
@136  = ~Hey!~
@137  = ~No trouble, fair lady!~
@138  = ~Tremendous! Bravo!~
@139  = ~Thank you kindly, young sir. Though I am merely the vessel for the author's words.~
@140  = ~I... Uh...~
@141  = ~Tis a pity it couldn't have been resolved in a nicer fashion. I guess not every tale can have a happy ending.~
@142  = ~Interesting. It seems there is much afoot in the Realms.~
@143  = ~That there is. Mayhap one day some of you will be a part of it. Think on that.~
@144  = ~That's the home of Thalantyr, a wise and powerful mage. I'd, uh, caution against trying to rob him, <CHARNAME>.~
@145  = ~Epic tales of villainy? Wow! Oh, <CHARNAME>, please!~
@146  = ~*gasp*~
@147  = ~Magnificent! Such a tale could fill any tavern or hall in all the Realms!~
@148  = ~Your kind words do warm this young bard's heart – which is useful, considering the weather here. I thank you most humbly.~
@149  = ~Say what, now?~
@150  = ~That doesn't sound too fitting for a priest of the Crying God such as yourself...~
@151  = ~The unearthly beauty of the elves steals many a man's heart...~
@152  = ~You've done the right thing, sir.~
@153  = ~He has enslaved a Nymph? A foul crime!~
@154  = ~Exactly. Will you help me... put matters right?~
@155  = ~I couldn't have put it better myself.~
@156  = ~Indeed! A veritable feast of vocabulary it may have been, while yet concise in it's praise. But such is still pittance compared to the glitz, the glamour, the personality which flows impersonally from the heart of this small metropolis.~
@157  = ~He's... got a point.~
@158  = ~Yes, listen to the child and be on your way.~
@159  = ~I'm sure we could keep our eyes open, milady.~
@160  = ~Well, thanks!~
@161  = ~Oh, my... I sure am glad to be an adventurer.~
@162  = ~The coronation! We're just in time!~
@163  = ~Oh, unspeakable horror!~
@164  = ~That does sound suspicious.~
@165  = ~He's right, <CHARNAME>. We shouldn't ignore a request like that.~
@166  = ~It speaks in riddles... I wonder what it means?~
@167  = ~You can say that again! This stinks!~
@168  = ~Well, murder at the hands of Cyric is the commonly accepted view of events. I, uh, sort of got lost after that bit.~
@169  = ~Such injustice! I, Garrick, will aid you, fair creature!~
@170  = ~Please! I cannot fight Ogre-Droth on my own, young human!~
@171  = ~Silke?~
@172  = ~Ah, Garrick. Do be a dear and shut up, won't you?~
@173  = ~So the people say!~
@174  = ~The Bitch Queen? Her clergy are most certainly evil and terrible people.~
@175  = ~Damn straight. So, will ye help us?~
@176  = ~Yes... That explains his continued sickness!~
@177  = ~Even the most blighted of souls can find love, it would seem. Your love must have been great, for it still to endure now.~
@178  = ~Yes, and... I'd do it all again. It is not his fault he was born like this. I love him still, and I will always.~
@179  = ~Well that was, uh, unusual.~
@180  = ~It would seem the situation is more complex than we were led to believe.~
@181  = ~Just go away!~
@182  = ~Oh, my!~
@183  = ~... because "luck" runs out... A good saying.~
@184  = ~And you would do well to remember it, young adventurers.~
@185  = ~Well met, sir, and farewell.~
@186  = ~A Cyricist, and first impressions would suggest his grip on reality is, uh, pretty loose...~
@187  = ~Tiax's grip is firm upon the weapons he uses to smite his foes! Firm as the stone from with Cyric's – and eventually Tiax's, too – Supreme Throne is hewn!~
@188  = ~Well, except for you maybe, kiddo.~
@189  = ~Luck, fate, chance... ‘Tis an interesting faith, that of Tymora. And he has a point – if he can raise the child, then why not?~
@190  = ~It's not too, uh, nice just to demand things you want from others, <CHARNAME>.~
@191  = ~Aren't you Volo, sir, the famous bard?~
@192  = ~That is indeed true, young one. If not a bard, then a peddler of tales at least. And who, pray tell, are you? I doubt my fame has spread wide enough that quite everybody has heard of me – and don't get me wrong, this is something for which I am thankful – so; would I be correct in thinking you too have the storyteller's soul?~
@193  = ~My name is Garrick, sir, and I would indeed style myself as a bard of sorts. Well I guess I'm, uh, still learning... ‘Tis an honor to meet you! Please regale us with one of your famous tales!~
@194  = ~Sounds like an, uh, interesting childhood there!~
@195  = ~I am... glad that you are so different from Sarevok, <CHARNAME>. I would hate for you to treat us as Sarevok treats his allies... Let's move on, I... I feel sick.~
@196  = ~That was, well, depressing.~
@197  = ~Wow!~
@198  = ~Exactly, my friend. What say ye?~
@199  = ~Thank you!~
@214  = ~They will not avail you!~
@217  = ~Ah, he's got those flesh monsters, anyway.~
@220  = ~Farewell.~
@1001 = ~Please, do!~
@1002 = ~Good luck!~
@1003 = ~DIE!~
@1004 = ~This way, please!~
@1005 = ~Cunning, isn't it?~
@1006 = ~Step right up!~
@1007 = ~I just want to be rid of it... please!~
@1008 = ~I'm warning you, go no closer! It's possessed!~
@1009 = ~Indeed. Farewell.~
@1010 = ~For poor Brage, this was about as "nice" as it could have been.~
@1011 = ~As it has stolen mine. Farewell...~
@1012 = ~Taugoz watching you.~
