@0    = ~I must say, this is the most inspiring tale I have heard about <CHARNAME> to date.~
@1    = ~Aye, little one...~
@2    = ~Prilly! Is it really you?~
@3    = ~Eh? Whozzat? Why, Eldoth! My boy, my boy. It has been a time, hasn't it?~
@4    = ~But... you... here? You were off to conquer the salons of Waterdeep, last I saw you.~
@5    = ~So I was. And so I did, for a time. But the Blackstaff is a cruel, hard man to run afoul of. Thus, I'm right pleased to be able to be here now.~
@6    = ~Hah! I should imagine! Still, I've always thought that priests were dodgey fellows. I am pleased to know so now, for certain.~
@7    = ~Oh, 'tisn't all scam, lad. My suffering's real enough.~
@8    = ~So it must be, else you'd have turned up as an acolyte of Lady Firehair, which, if I recall, was always your true devotion.~
@9    = ~Sune, eh? Well, I won't deny that I am still acquainted with some... practical practitioners of the Lady's arts. Y'see, there's this place called the Undercellar, and...~
@10   = ~Ahem! I think these reminiscences have gone on *quite* long enough. We have a task that we must be about.~
@11   = ~The Undercellar? It is there we must go! At once!~
@12   = ~We've been there. The most interesting feature of the place is the brace of assassins we killed.~
@13   = ~Oooh, a proper young fogey, aren't we? Well, then, off with you, and I hope you like your suffering neat, when you find it.~
@14   = ~No fear, oh mentor of my youth. <CHARNAME>'s well fermented in that brew. And... er... something to prolong your agony.~
@15   = ~Greetings, travelers, what can I do... YOU!!! Guards! GUARDS!!!~
@16   = ~It is not a 'need'. It is my very great pleasure!~
@17   = ~Uh... anyone want to tell me what all the shouting's about?~
@18   = ~This... vagabond!... offered to "sing for his supper." We get little entertainment here, so I thought it worth the chance. HA! Within two insulting songs, he had the whole place in riot! Took me a fortnight to repair all the damage.~
@19   = ~Including the three bottles you made off with, when the trouble started.~
@20   = ~Hmph!~
@21   = ~You're back? Say what you want, and be quick about it!~
@22   = ~Whee! Aren't you the ardent young creature, then?~
@23   = ~No, no. Our enemies have set a rendezvous there. We must catch them!~
@24   = ~Ha! Prefer your cut-and-thrust to slap-and-tickle, eh? You'll learn in time - if you are granted time. Young Eldoth, there, would make you a good teacher.~
@25   = ~Sure, sure. One of the girls is a disguised green dragon, is it? Bet it's that new bird, Mistie, that everyone's... no. Well, I will show you a... private... entrance. But try not to wreck the place entirely, eh? I do suffer sublimely there!~
@26   = ~Find yourself the right girdle, and I *will* school you, lad. *sigh* Of course, at my age, you'd have to imagine a deal of it...~
@27   = ~Ah, returned you are. Care for the naughty jaunt, then?~
@28   = ~Yes, I think we should go there.~
@29   = ~Uh... no. Forget I blundered back in here.~
@30   = ~Ah, sweet evening crowns the hottest day. This way.~
@31   = ~Now, now, good sir. No need to upset your house on my account.~
@32   = ~You should not have provided so much... or such excellent... wine with the meal, then, good sir.~
@33   = ~But that was then, this is now. I am... alas... perfectly sober and shall remain so whilst under your roof, I daresay. You will also note that I enjoy the estimable... and capable... company of <CHARNAME> on this visit. So might we partake of your offerings, if you please?~
@34   = ~O, Prilly, Prilly...~
@35   = ~The filigree of Wenroth town
Is cast afire by the evening sun.
Come, my love, let us go down
To see how Time limns wealth renown'd.~
@36   = ~You're quoting that old goat? Sounds to me like one more excuse to get his girl friends out-of-doors of an evening.~
@37   = ~That old fraud again? Speaking of whom, weren't you awfully generous to him with *our* money?~
@38   = ~Phhhtt!~
@39   = ~No fear, oh mentor of my youth. We shall be discreet. And... er... something to prolong your agony.~
@40   = ~Ha! Had I learnt but a tithe of your lessons, I'd be a master, indeed! Oh... and a little something to prolong your agony.~
@41   = ~Yes, indeed. So many approaches - so few, so very few, women worthy of their use.~
@42   = ~I... well... Dammit! He was a good man... a *great* poet. I cannot abide the thought of his having to boil his loincloth to make broth out of the lice which infest it.~
@43   = ~Ah, the sweet smell of ill-gotten gains. I wonder if any are lying about?~
@44   = ~Let us be quick, <CHARNAME>. I like not these precincts.~
@45   = ~Really? I'd have thought you, of all people, would feel right at home here.~
@46   = ~Then I am pleased to save you from my error. The Lady has never glanced at me but with a cocked eye. This accounts for my conservative tastes and tactics, you see.~
@47   = ~<CHARNAME>, I owe you an apology. What I had taken for a dull streak, was but the residuum of this dust-ridden mausoleum.~
@48   = ~It's quiet, I'll grant, but not that bad. People learning and thinking can't be expected to sound like Carnival at Waterdeep, you know.~
@49   = ~I don't expect that... but learning should be to some purpose, not an end in itself. After a childhood here, where knowledge skulks, then dies, I am amazed you have survived a life on the road.~
@50   = ~Y'know, <CHARNAME>, I've been aboard more than a few ships, but never one with quite these amenities. I wonder, when this is all done, if we might charter her for a quiet, celebratory cruise.~
@51   = ~If it is to be quiet, why sail away from the dock? This tub looks like it would flounder under attack by flying fish.~
@52   = ~By 'quiet' I meant it shouldn't be audible to the mainland from five leagues out at sea. And a suitable success on our part, aptly publicized... it would be a point of honor for many of these resplendently attired citizens to attend.~
@53   = ~Forget it! When this is done, I'm going to dig a hole, crawl in and become a radish. I most definitely am NOT going to sponsor your mass fleecing of the richest, and loudest talking, nobles in Baldur's Gate.~
@54   = ~Ha! Ha! I do hope your tuberous ambitions come to naught; you are so full of insight. A quick score would be in poor taste... and make it all the more difficult to evade retribution. A solid percentage from a more... permanent establishment, though, might be arranged.~
@55   = ~The sooner you lot are gone, the better I'll be pleased.~
@56   = ~Luskan's the place for vagrants like yourselves. Head there, why don't you?~
@57   = ~'Tis said that Westgate is lovely this time of year. Why don't you go there - or anywhere else - and see for yourselves?~
@58   = ~The custom you bring ain't worth the custom you drive off; nevermind the damages.~
@59   = ~Go away!~
@60   = ~BEAT IT!!!~
