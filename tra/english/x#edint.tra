@0    = ~I am not willing to kill without sufficient reason. Come with us, and if we find your 'Dynaheir' we will decide how to proceed.~
@1    = ~Never double-cross a Red Wizard of Thay, <CHARNAME>. Unfortunately, you will not live to enjoy the benefits of this lesson.~
@2    = ~Have I not told you that I shall return? I was busying myself with preparing a surprise for you.~
@3    = ~The Red Wizards of Thay are not known for their magnanimous nature. You've slighted one of our number, Edwin, and it's an offense to us all. We're going to have to kill you.~
@4    = ~Tell me, creature, who taught you the words 'two hundred'? For I am entirely sure that you cannot count it out. If you wish to prove me wrong, please do so out loud, and we should pay you the whole thousand for your efforts. But under one condition: you and your companions should all close your eyes, while you're counting.~
@5    = ~Oh... yeah. Close your eyes!~
@6    = ~One...~
@7    = ~Two...~
@8    = ~And what are you waiting for, <CHARNAME>? The countdown?~
@9    = ~Four...~
@10   = ~A wise decision. One can never be too cautious dealing with... her kind. (Yes, I shall watch for her carefully.)~
@11   = ~Boo and I will watch you, wizard...~
@12   = ~Keep that stinking rodent away from me. And the little smelly creature he carries, too.~
@13   = ~I have met a man named Edwin near Nashkel, who tried to hire us to kill a dangerous witch named Dynaheir. I shall have to be wary of both of them.~
@14   = ~So utterly naive... and not quite so bad looking... (A deadly combination indeed. For a simian, that is.)~
@15   = ~Beg your pardon, sir, but there is nothing evil 'bout this littl' cherry.~
@16   = ~Wench, the aging concubines of Thay cover the lamps with pink shades to create a lighting effect more favorable to their failing charms. I see... or, rather, I guess, that you have done the same, choosing a mine as habitat. Surely, in the darkness even you might pass as a woman for a local baboon.~
@17   = ~My lady, it is my understanding that entropy is the degradation of matter and energy in the universe to an ultimate state of inert uniformity. If that is what your soul sister and you are prepared to exemplify with your heavenly bodies, I am quite intrigued and willing to lend mine for such experimentation... (Yes, yes, I have achieved a delightful proportion of philosophy and risqué, but why did I even bother? I am sure that a simple 'yes' was sufficient - they are not accustomed to my level of sophistication in this barbaric land.)~
@18   = ~<CHARNAME>, it will surely break my heart to kill these beautiful, innocent creatures... (That should be enough to dissuade <PRO_HIMHER>; all the two-penny heroes are forever fools for gooey whining of the sort... and supplying exotic concubines is a profitable business. All that is needed now is a ship and a couple of sturdy nets.)~
@19   = ~Your pickled brain, if you please, and a thousand gold, as a reward for removing the worst merchandise in your store for you.~
@20   = ~I swear, sir, it is not quite as bad as it er... appears.~
@21   = ~I shall not leave without teaching you two lessons: firstly, do not hire a Red Wizard of Thay for such petty tasks, and secondly - if you made the huge mistake of doing so, you should never call him a fool afterwards.~
@22   = ~Surely, if Fate itself brought you before <CHARNAME>, only <PRO_HISHER> untimely death shall prevent <PRO_HIMHER> from hearing you out. (Is it not amusing how women would invent most anything to justify their desire to gossip?)~
@23   = ~My dear Mayor, from the looks of you, your idea of a handsome reward is a couple of chickens... or is it a pound of butter?~
@24   = ~Au contraire, there is plenty of time. I would say, about fifteen years until the boy matures without interference from his empty-headed squawking mother. If I were him, I would have chosen worgs' company over yours, as well.~
@25   = ~No matter how deeply flattered I am by being entrusted with such a blessed assignment, I feel that any benefit that we could possibly rip from performing this mission is not worthy of risking staining my robes with refuse.~
@26   = ~(If I became desperate enough in this unenlightened land to reduce myself to discussing magic with hedge witches, I might have noted that casting spells is not making a stew. Magic components don't stain the hand which touched them.)~
@27   = ~*throws a meaningful look <CHARNAME>'s way* (Unless, of course, it is a highly inexperienced hand...)~
@28   = ~Brilliant. Brother Thurm's performance was just the thing I was longing for the entire day... <CHARNAME>, I urge you to execute this lot, before we have the chance to enjoy the sounds produced by the vocal cords of the undead.~
@29   = ~I would not waste money on this pathetic mausoleum. In this barbaric land, a flint is regarded as the latest invention. (Besides - the brazen boldness, impudent assurance and insolence of praising machinery in my presence! As if gadgets could even be compared with the elegance or efficiency of magic.)~
@30   = ~I am sure, sir, that you will find it to your liking.~
@31   = ~Oh, my lord Odesseiron... how have you been? The girls were asking after you.~
@32   = ~I shall renew some acquaintances with delight. (Does he expect me to be surprised by the fact that my exceptional persona had been forever imprinted in their memory?)~
@33   = ~Thank you for your patronage.~
@34   = ~Why, thank you kindly, Madame. (Their noblewomen are even stupider than their tavern maids.)~
@35   = ~Oh, the gory details of the conquest of this insurmountable fortress... Truly, my head is spinning with excitement.~
@36   = ~*Edwin is filing his nails.* A large tree, standing on its own, must be full of gold... I can only envy your perception, gentlemen. Or perhaps it is made entirely of gold under that deceiving layer of bark?~
@37   = ~Uh-huh, that may be.~
@38   = ~That'd be lotsa gold... the tree is big. Even if roots 're silvar.~
@39   = ~Well, do not just stand there - keep chopping, and you are bound to find out.~
@40   = ~Ya hear that, Krumm? We got helpers.. Ya do wanna in, aren't ya?~
@41   = ~Your power of observation is stunning, drow.~
@42   = ~Should I weep now? (Such suffering, such unease...)~
@43   = ~Surely, the simple appearance of Drizzt Do'Urden should have sent every bandit flying by now. Or do the bards' tales exaggerate your deadliness, drow? Ah, it is of little importance; it is quite possible that the bandits around here have had no chance of hearing the exhilarating tales about the fires burning in your lavender eyes, the mesmerizing dance of death that your little swords do, or the accursed crossdown parry. (Or the back-flip of instant doom, or the diary pages of instant nosebleed...)~
@44   = ~I am genuinely awed by your powers of reasoning... why, we would have had such a hard time understanding that the bounty grows proportionally to the difficulty of the task.~
@45   = ~Why, if one must chose between practicing wit or blade, I say that you have made the right choice, Drizzt Do'Urden, by becoming a swordsman. Ah, wait, I am forgetting that it was your father who made that choice for you...~
@46   = ~A plea, if I may - please, please, do not mention this meeting in your diaries. My name could not stand... er, the honor.~
@47   = ~The pleasure is all yours, I am most assured.~
@48   = ~This grand city is but a multitude of crooked alleys, where one can chance upon the most idiotic characters. But what are the chances of running into the very same idiot twice, and in such close timing? <CHARNAME>, you attract fools, like rotting flesh attracts flies.~
@49   = ~If you ask me, <CHARNAME>, we'd better avoid the fight and just give her twenty gold. It would be a small sum to pay for the privilege of not having to drag around this stupid cow and her rusty sword.~
@50   = ~Amazing. I dare anyone to believe in the purity of love after hearing this particular statement of intent.~
@51   = ~For a love-blinded fool, he sees well enough how to profit from a stranger's stupidity. Angel skins are expensive this year, <CHARNAME>...~
@52   = ~So, she is still alive... Hurry, <CHARNAME>, before I have my prize barbequed, courtesy of these unwashed wildlings. ~
@53   = ~I have yet to decide what amused me more: the level of precaution equal to that of a drunken duergar trying to court a Matron Mother that this man exhibited while setting up a trap for you, or the wit which almost caught up to the speed of a magically slowed zombie that you exercised while hanging onto his every word. Are the two of you related, per chance?~
@54   = ~It has been my experience, that in the matters of life and death it is always beneficial to lie. But you can be truthful with these goons, if you wish - they have this particular look about them... how should I call it? Ah, 'pawns doomed to be slaughtered momentarily'.~
@55   = ~Even if I have heard your name, it would have escaped me, fledgling swordsman... It does not hold sufficient sonority. As compared to, say, Edwin Odesseiron... (Now, there is true magnificence!)~
@56   = ~How lovely. Now we are saving chickens from big bad wolves. I hear that your earliest heroic deed was bringing an antidote for a cow that was sick to her stomach. Perhaps farming for you would be a more suitable occupation than adventuring, <CHARNAME>. Just think of the many mighty vegetables you'd be able to produce, wielding your magical pitchfork! (I suffer so!)~
@57   = ~*cluck* The wolf! The wolf is coming!~
@58   = ~You have minions? And I've all but taken you for one...~
@59   = ~It was only your brain, peasant.~
@60   = ~The oldest trick of the incompetent is to cover their impotency up with a show of righteous outrage. More common amongst paladins, though, than among the students of arcane.~
@61   = ~I have to agree, for I do come from glorious Thay, which is only a few years away from proving to the rest of Faerun that it is indeed the center of the universe.~
@62   = ~Gods save us from plague and poets. (I should have fled when I had the time. Into the hills, the hills, I say!)~
@63   = ~Ah, I would say it is 'into the ruins, into the ruins!' I don't envy your fortune, sir. I do not mind standing around here to soak up the ambient melancholy grace, but to go underground... no, sir!~
@64   = ~I suspect that between both of you there is, perhaps, a flea's bellyful of reason.~
@65   = ~Oh? How droll.~
@66   = ~<CHARNAME>, this woman's offer sounds quite... intriguing. Surely you cannot pass the opportunity of rescuing a damsel in distress? (Yes, that ought to give them a small push in the right direction... They'll do most of the work, and, knowing the effect that I have on women, I should reap all of the pleasure. Finally, something worthy of my attention!)~
@67   = ~(Fishermen ask me to help them to go out to sea... next, the farmers will plead for me to help them to sow. I am becoming truly indispensable to the agriculture of this region.) Please, <CHARNAME>, just say... NO!~
@68   = ~*Edwin sighs* What did I say about farmers being next in line after fishermen? I hold my breath, O glorious leader... Could it be sheep-shearers laying in wait to beg our assistance behind that pile of manure?~
@69   = ~Her unmerited arrogance bores me, <CHARNAME>. Shall we finish this now, before our lunch grows cold?~
@70   = ~Notice that she has acknowledged the presence of our weapons, yet still addresses us in an arrogant manner; childhood is a time when logic and self-preservation are alien concepts. This one will not grow to find out just how valuable the skills she never acquired were.~
@71   = ~<CHARNAME>, the one who mingles in slaves' affairs is lowering <PRO_HIMHER>self to their shameful station.~
@72   = ~Creep.~
@73   = ~How? Why? Whyyyy? Such a loss to the world it is! <CHARNAME> we must go to a temple immediately, else many tears will fall! (and they won't be all mine, I assure you!)~
@74   = ~Who said I was talking to you? But I am done with you nonetheless. Go.~
@75   = ~And I am underwhelmed.~
@76   = ~I've forgotten it already.~
@77   = ~If they haven't rrrrrroassted herrrr by now!~
@78   = ~Go now, and do what you must.~
@79   = ~Silence!~
@80   = ~Begone, skeptic!~
@81   = ~Or your bodies do.~
@1001 = ~Your name? I've forgotten it already.~
@1002 = ~Do not squander the opportunity before you.~
@1003 = ~Die, mageling!~
