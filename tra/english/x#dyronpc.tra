@69   = ~Come here, Dynaheir, darling. I think it's time for me to give you a few tips... First - your hair. *Safana purses her lips thoughtfully.* Now, such mess can only be excused in two cases: if your mother used you for a broom, and if crows chose you head for their nest.~
@70   = ~But do not despair. It's nothing that a weekly oil soak can't fix. Plus of course... how many brush strokes do you give it nightly?~
@71   = ~I do not understand thy meaning...~
@72   = ~I thought so. *patiently* Darling, each woman should have the number one hundred etched in big fiery letters on her heart where her hair is concerned.~

@86   = ~Oh, no, certainly not an incapacitation.~
@87   = ~'Tis solved then...~
@88   = ~Wait, I go *further* than claiming that a meager and temporary malfunction results. I postulate that the very *ability* to fall in love is a feature of an inferior being. Please, allow me to elaborate.~

@92   = ~Hmmph, I see. To keep it short and simple - because, let's face it, I obviously have to - he displays numerous outward signs of idiocy. But inward changes are no less telling... He rejects wise counsel in the same haughty manner you do when I-~
@93   = ~Dynaheir? Dynaheir?~
@94   = ~<CHARNAME>, can you talk less with glorious Dynaheir in the evenings? Minsc and Boo have to stand guard, and it makes him very sleepy. Boo explains some things to Minsc, but it's still hard to keep awake. And butt-kicking needs lots of cons- what was it Boo? Consent? No, not that... con-cen-tra-tion!~
@95   = ~Sorry, Minsc. I will try to be brief next time. To tell you the truth, I do not understand some things Dynaheir says, either.~
@96   = ~Minsc, the problem could be easily resolved if you stop listening to us. Let us assume that I take over your duties when I converse with Dynaheir.~
@97   = ~*sigh* Ask Boo to try harder. He might be able to convey the important point that when a man and a woman put their heads together and speak quietly, they desire privacy.~
@98   = ~Many thanks, <CHARNAME>.~
@99   = ~No, no. That's not right! Dynaheir is Minsc's witch. <CHARNAME> can't be Dynaheir's bodyguard, just like Minsc can't be Gorion's son! Right, Boo?~
@100  = ~Ah, next time we come to a market, Boo, you look for those little brown seeds that wake Minsc up! We will need many of those.~
@101  = ~Minsc understands. Minsc's friend in Rashemen once met a lady, and they, too, wanted that privacy thing. Only the lady was not Minsc's charge.~
@102  = ~<CHARNAME>, Boo says that you love Dynaheir.~
@103  = ~Are you... uncomfortable with this er... development?~
@104  = ~Minsc, while we are on the subject, I was wondering - what do you feel toward Dynaheir?~

@109  = ~But, other than that, we think that we approve.~
@110  = ~Dynaheir is Minsc's witch, and he protects her - it is his dajemma. If anyone breaks Dynaheir's heart, Minsc will have to take his to fix the damage. And Minsc is no wizard, so it can get messy.~
@111  = ~<CHARNAME> should not say things like that, even joking.~
@112  = ~Eh, Dynaheir.~
@113  = ~Yes? Thou look'st worried, my friend.~
@114  = ~Minsc and Boo had been watching their witch, and they noticed that Dynaheir is unwell.~
@115  = ~Thou art mistaken.~
@116  = ~See, Boo, human women are just like hamsters - they hide their hurts.~
@117  = ~*squeak*~ [GAM_48]
@118  = ~Yes Boo, next time you eat too many xvarts eyes, you will tell me straight away.~
@119  = ~But what should we do about Dynaheir?~
@120  = ~Yes, Boo, that's right. We will be on guard against anyone who upsets Dynaheir.~
@121  = ~<CHARNAME>? No, Boo, I think you are wrong. <CHARNAME> is brave, and he saved Dynaheir.~
@122  = ~Minsc! *softly* Thou art doing thy duties marvelously. Thou dost not need to step up thine efforts.~
@123  = ~Psst, Dynaheir... Boo says, beware of skinny Edwin. He smells something foul, and it's not gnoll droppings.~
@124  = ~I am always on my guard against the Thayvian.~
@125  = ~Yes, but step doubly careful, my witch. See how Boo's whiskers tremble in angst?~
@126  = ~'Tis wind picking up.~
@127  = ~Er... now it's wind. But before it was not! Boo tells me that the Evil Red Wizard is hatching a new plot, because of Dynaheir and <CHARNAME>.~
@128  = ~That he would, beyond all doubts.~
@129  = ~Dynaheir, Minsc is very strong, and Boo is smarter than any other giant space hamster. And the giant space hamsters are very smart.~
@130  = ~*absently* Yes, Minsc.~
@131  = ~Then glorious Dynaheir will not have <CHARNAME> in place of Minsc and Boo?~
@132  = ~Why would I do that?~
@133  = ~Well. Minsc and Boo fought like lions, but the filthy dogmen spirited Dynaheir away. And <CHARNAME> saved her... But he can't be stronger than Minsc or smarter than Boo.~
@134  = ~Regardless of <CHARNAME>'s most admirable qualities, 'tis a Rashemi berserker that should guard me per ages long custom. I will not break it.~
@135  = ~You hear that, Boo? You hear that? Hurrah to Dynaheir and Minsc and Boo!~
@136  = ~Er... Dynaheir? Boo still thinks that Dynaheir would rather travel with <CHARNAME> than with Minsc and Boo.~
@137  = ~Thou should set Boo's mind at ease, Minsc.~
@138  = ~Minsc has tried! 'Boo,' Minsc said, 'If our witch said no, then it's no.'~
@139  = ~But whenever Minsc looks at Dynaheir, she is with <CHARNAME>! She talks to <CHARNAME>, or watches <CHARNAME>, or walks near <CHARNAME>.~
@140  = ~Minsc sees it, too!~
@141  = ~I do not forget my old friends because I have made a new one.~
@142  = ~Then soon it will be as before? Just Minsc, and Boo, and Dynaheir traveling together?~
@143  = ~*sigh* No one knoweth what future hath in store. For now 'tis important that we follow <CHARNAME>.~
@144  = ~So, Boo... Dynaheir tells us not to worry.~
@145  = ~Yes, she likes <CHARNAME> but not the same way she likes Minsc and Boo.~
@146  = ~Yes, I agree. Dynaheir likes <CHARNAME> just like women do with men they are like to marry. Eh, so many 'like's' no wonder we get confused!~
@147  = ~Minsc and Boo think that after they are admitted to the Ice Berserker's Lodge, they should ask if <CHARNAME> can join, too.~
@148  = ~Minsc, thou mean'st well, but <CHARNAME> is not Rashemi, so 'tis unlikely that he should ever be in a position to enjoy the benefits of this membership.~
@149  = ~Not here, but after he comes to Rashemen-~
@150  = ~<CHARNAME> will not come to Rashemen.~
@151  = ~Of course he will! He will not leave glorious Dynaheir. And if he tries, Minsc will track him down and kick his evil butt-~
@152  = ~I thought that thou didst not want <CHARNAME> to travel with us.~
@153  = ~That was before Minsc understood things. Nobody can protect Dynaheir better than Minsc and Boo! But Dynaheir wants <CHARNAME>, too, for other needs. So we will return to Rashemen together.~
@154  = ~Let us... let us not look so far ahead, Minsc.~
@155  = ~Minsc tries to look far, after the gnolls had stolen Dynaheir from him!~
@156  = ~Tell me this, Kivan - should Deheriana have asked thee not to spend thy years seeking to avenge her beforehand, would'st thou have listened?~
@157  = ~I am not a man of 'should have' and 'would have', Dynaheir.~
@158  = ~That l know, and yet-~
@159  = ~I have no answer for you save this: I have always stood against those who would torture innocents. I was raised that way... Deheriana made me into a kinder man.~
@160  = ~Living - yes... but if not for her death, would'st thou walk thy path so single-mindedly with no regard for your own life or happiness?~
@161  = ~Is Dynaheir talking to me, or herself?~
@162  = ~To myself, I suppose. Forgive mine indiscretion, Kivan.~
@163  = ~It's young <CHARNAME>'s love that troubles you, is that it? You look at him and you see me, should something happen to you.~
@164  = ~Yes.~
@165  = ~You can no more order happiness than forbid falling in love. Bind a man to what he cannot do, and you will twist his soul into something worse than what you perceive in me. He would hold to his oath by doing what he thinks is wrong... or he'd break it without knowing if he betrayed, and if he'd be forgiven. Give it a thought, before doing anything.~
@166  = ~There is a sad certainty in thy words. *She sighs.* Perhaps, there is indeed nothing to it, but to remain troubled and give no voice to my concern... or, perhaps, not.~
@167  = ~You'd do better by not dying, Dynaheir.~
@168  = ~*quietly* I can do many things, Master Elf, but this I cannot.~
@169  = ~<CHARNAME>, I c-congratulate you. The lady Dynaheir has great nobility of heart and mind.~
@170  = ~Yes, that's what attracts me. I like milksops no more than you do.~
@171  = ~*shrug* I don't think I should meet a different type among an adventuring crowd.~
@172  = ~I'm more into how she looks. Didn't suspect, though, that you picked Jaheira for her personality.~
@173  = ~Oh? It is not mere savor to which I... Ah, forgive me. I have followed you for some t-time now and I forgot how young you really are.~
@174  = ~You will. Ind-deed, you have. I hope you will *learn* the difference for yourself... before d-disaster forces the lesson on you.~
@175  = ~So c-callow! I really think... Oh! You're trying to get me to mind my own business, aren't you? Sorry.~
@176  = ~*coughs* Dynaheir, might we have a quick woman-to-woman chat?~
@177  = ~Neither of us is likely to enjoy it, Jaheira.~
@178  = ~Agreed, yet Gorion had appointed Khalid and myself as <CHARNAME>'s guardians.~
@179  = ~Thusly thou must pry?~
@180  = ~Mine is not the idle curiosity of an old wife! I would question the motives of any woman who would try to induce a boyish infatuation in <CHARNAME>. Especially if she belongs to a secretive ruling clique, and that she 'accidentally' arrived to the Sword Coast from far away.~
@181  = ~Hathran, I was told, do not travel in search of pleasant diversions or for a change of scenery, nor do they waste their time by toying with the heads and hearts of young men.~
@182  = ~So, dost thou consider <CHARNAME> a boy or a man?~
@183  = ~I have not thought about him in those... terms. He is my charge by Gorion's will, and I will not have him harmed or hoodwinked. By anyone.~
@184  = ~I have not known Gorion. But I know <CHARNAME> enough to assure thee that he is very much a man grown and not a biddable sort. But I do know <CHARNAME> enough to tell thee that he will not approve thy peeking into his heart. And neither do I.~
@185  = ~If it is a matter of heart - be at your ease, for I will not trouble you any more. But if I ever catch a whiff of cold calculation - I will not stand by.~
@186  = ~<CHARNAME>! Look what I... *giggle* Hey! I caught ya staring at Dynaheir again!~
@187  = ~I know, what's up!~
@188  = ~We gotta' have the talk!~
@189  = ~The Talk? Gorion gave me the Talk ten years ago!~

@197  = ~Imoen, you have come dangerously close to endangering our friendship. Step no further!~

@205  = ~Nope. Pay attention, you!~
@206  = ~Grumpy pants! *She sticks her tongue out at you.*~

@213  = ~Yep, and that's where they should stay.~
@214  = ~No! Er... what I meant is that, ah... Well, every tale needs a great romance. Just a few weeks ago you were an average runaway, fresh out of the walls of Candlekeep... and now, wow!~
@215  = ~I think it could be bedtime for you, Garrick. Truly, every time you've had one mug of ale too many you go all misty eyed.~

@239  = ~It happens to pass if companions grow to genuinely care for one another. However, 'tis strongly discouraged. The goal of a dajemma is to seek knowledge of a different kind.~
@240  = ~And that is mighty wise counsel, my lady! Forgive me for prying. If not for my listening to fanciful tales, I would not have suspected a good woman, of your station, to have behaved improperly!~
@241  = ~Tales, such as?~
@242  = ~Nothing, my lady, nothing! I understand that your attention to <CHARNAME> is that of a wise mentor and a friend, not the behavior of a lewd woman, accustomed to disgrace.~
@243  = ~Whoa! I say 'buns' when I smell cinnamon! So, miss Dynaheir, one is never too old for a bit of lovin', eh?~ [ALORA99]
@244  = ~Indeed. But some never grow mature enough to either love or respect.~
@245  = ~Tee-hee! Love's no boiling kettle o' fish to hold it with mittens!~
@246  = ~Methinks thou art hungry again, Alora.~
@247  = ~O, yeah. Now would be as good a time as any for a luncheon. *She winks and giggles.* Since ya have <CHARNAME>'s ear, and all...~
@248  = ~<CHARNAME> is apparently quite the savior of damsels in distress.~
@249  = ~Are you mocking me, mageling?~
@250  = ~O, no, for I also was rescued from great peril.~
@251  = ~As was the drow woman.~
@252  = ~And Eldoth convinced Skie that she was delivered, as well.~
@253  = ~Quite unusual. It sets my mind to thinking of bards' tales, wherein once the Hero saveth the Princess, there is little he can do but marry her.~
@254  = ~That rotten profiteer Zeke called me a Northern Princess to attract the attention of fools, but a Princess I am not!~
@255  = ~Then thou would'st not harbor romantic aspirations for <CHARNAME>?~
@256  = ~And if I do, what business is it of yours, Dynaheir? Unless of course you 'harbor' some...~
@257  = ~Nay, 'tis not that... 'Tis every historian's desire to see how much truth the song doth preserve.~
@258  = ~Curse you for a fool, Dynaheir, with your foolish talk of <CHARNAME>!~
@259  = ~Why, what fault hast thou found in me?~
@260  = ~Bah, mageling, I have no liking for sugarcoating garlic. Ever heard the saying that the apple your rival is reaching for is always the sweetest one on the tree?~
@261  = ~Dost thou imply that mine interest in <CHARNAME> fuels thine and vice versa?~
@262  = ~Aye, and I do not like it a single bit!~
@263  = ~Neither do I.~
@264  = ~Shall we toss a coin, Dynaheir?~
@265  = ~Thou canst not be serious!~
@266  = ~Our foes had been cut asunder
Dogs ravage their entrails now
Crows pluck away their eyes
Their bones will turn to dust!~
@267  = ~PRAISE TEMPUS! PRAISE VICTORY!~
@268  = ~*She coughs uncomfortably.* Branwen, canst thou be more discreet?~
@269  = ~Discreet?! 'Tis the greatest joy for a warrior to drive her enemies before her till they are annihilated! I want to shout to the whole world that I am victorious, and they are dead!~
@270  = ~Thou remind'st me strongly of Minsc, perhaps too strongly.~
@271  = ~*snort* And is there something wrong with it?~
@272  = ~'Tis not womanly.~
@273  = ~And the magic finger-wiggling is? Perhaps you count on being rescued by <CHARNAME> every time you get yourself cornered, but I refuse to! I fight, and I take pride in it!~
@274  = ~I will have thee know that- *She cringes suddenly.* Since when did we start looking for flaws in one another?~
@275  = ~*disgustedly* Gah!~
@276  = ~By the Three! Branwen, I was just counting how many times <CHARNAME> smiled at either of us.~
@277  = ~Who won?~
@278  = ~*with exasperation* 'Tis not the point.~
@279  = ~'Twas me today, then. Yesterday 'twas you... Should we share? In some tribes, I heard 'tis done.~
@280  = ~*faintly* Share? Art we Thayvians to submit ourselves willingly to the role of concubines?~
@281  = ~The coin, then?~
@282  = ~'Tis below any woman to let a coin decide such a thing!~
@283  = ~O, go ahead, put ye nose up in the air! I hope you put it up so high that you faint. Or break your neck.~
@284  = ~Dynaheir, I'll go for heads.~
@285  = ~Tails then.~
@286  = ~*Branwen tosses the coin.*~
@287  = ~By the Three! Where didst thou get this coin?~
@288  = ~Auril's icicles! In my purse, of course.~
@289  = ~I gather that we did get our answer.~
@290  = ~What kind of an answer is that if the coin stands on its rib?!~
@291  = ~'Tis to tell us that we are equally favored by fate. *She picks up the coin and hands it back to Branwen.* Here, put it back in thy purse. The time for games hath passed.~
@292  = ~I regret very much mine involvement in this contest. I will avoid courting <CHARNAME>'s favor from this moment on.~
@293  = ~My honor dictates that I do the same, Dynaheir. There is no glory in a handed down victory.~
@294  = ~Branwen, thou dost realize that thy stubbornness brings us back to where we had started?~
@295  = ~Not entirely. For we both now shun <CHARNAME>.~
@296  = ~Indeed.~
@297  = ~The way I see it, Dynaheir, in war and in love 'tis all too easy to lose one's honor.~
@298  = ~So at least we kept ours.~
@299  = ~*Having learned of the affection that Branwen and Dynaheir have for you, you decide that it is better to leave the matters as is.*~
@300  = ~*Having learned of the affection that Branwen and Dynaheir have for you, you decide that your own heart greatly desires Branwen. From that moment on, you tactfully exhibit your preference.*~
@301  = ~*Having learned of the affection that Branwen and Dynaheir have for you, you decide that your own heart greatly desires Dynaheir. From that moment on, you tactfully exhibit your preference.*~
@302  = ~Well, look at you sweet-talking the witch! Boy, you have it in you, after all... who would have known! I'm holding my breath to see whom you'll go after next.~
@303  = ~Whate'er are you talking about, Coran?~
@304  = ~Yep. Want a lesson or two?~
@305  = ~Coran, I am not like you... Dynaheir is the only-~
@306  = ~Why, about the fiery wizardess you've tamed, of course! It's quite an accomplishment.~
@307  = ~O, *that* one? Want a lesson or two?~
@308  = ~Sure, only a fool refuses to hear a good tale. I am all for encouraging the young talent.~
@309  = ~My secret is to love, Coran. No games. Dynaheir is the only-~
@310  = ~'Tis a genius of sorts, a talent to the science of the tender passion, Coran. The main thing is to know how to appear 'new' every time. And then, depending on the woman's disposition and mood - choose the strategy of the day. At one time you can shock innocence with daring mockery; at another you will put fear in her by a show of despair. And yet another time colorful flattery is needed. You should appear proud or obedient in turn, attentive to every need and then careless... Your glance will change from wild to soft, from ashamed to daring, and sometimes... sometimes a hint of tears is recommended. Wait for that minute when you can hear the first tender motion of her heart and then pursue it relentlessly. Wit and passion, Coran, will win you any heart.~
@311  = ~*winks* Of course. Next time, let's do it when she is within earshot.~
@312  = ~O, that old shoe... I am glad you know it. It is as good a guide for a beginner as any.~
@313  = ~Did you think that you could play your pathetic little games and escape my notice, witch? It is just like women to use their bodies instead of their minds to advance. (Why have not I hired a group led by a woman?)~ [EDWIN99]
@314  = ~Edwin, thou art crowding me. Stand back.~
@315  = ~Or what? You will complain to <CHARNAME> that I have accused you of manipulating his attentions? (It would make for a delightful performance, no doubt...)~
@316  = ~No man in his right mind would believe your vile accusations.~
@317  = ~He who is gullible enough to fall for your cheap charms does not deserve to be called a man.~
@318  = ~My young friend... If you are capable of assimilating one bit of my supreme advice, let it be this: Rashemi witches always have a hidden intent. She lures you now with her insidious promises and you walk into her trap willingly. (Now that should be enough to arouse suspicions in a blind, mute and deaf sheep that had been raised on a secluded island by a group of particularly lawful and stupid paladins.)~ [EDWIN99]
@319  = ~And your advice comes from a pure heart, I take it?~
@320  = ~I trust Dynaheir, and no amount of gossip will change that.~
@321  = ~O, quit it, Edwin. Why would a Hathran need to manipulate a simple lad like me?~
@322  = ~I find it difficult to believe that a Hathran would want a pocket Bhaalspawn.~
@323  = ~Well, Edwin, thank you for your advice. I will keep my eyes open for a trap from now on.~
@324  = ~I will let no woman make me dance as she pulls the strings! Thank you for your warning, Edwin. Dynaheir is nobody to me from now on.~
@325  = ~No good advice comes from a disinterested person, <CHARNAME>. It is jarring to see you dancing when the Rashemi pulls, so I am telling you that I see the many strings...~
@326  = ~A Wychlaran's intentions are never plain. Her price is always higher than she leads you to believe when she persuades you to agree to her services... There are easier ways to solicit attention of far more honest women than that... Dynaheir. Where you pay up-front for the pleasures you desire.~
@327  = ~And so would I, friend... (His gullibility is worrying: stupid as she is, the witch is likely to undo my cunning work. Perhaps I should search for another way to eliminate her influence on him...)~
@328  = ~That's right, <CHARNAME>, that's right. You always decide for yourself.~
@329  = ~Your drooling, when you ogle the witch, moves me to laughter... or to tears. (To bowel movement, if I should be entirely accurate.) From your display of juvenile lust, I conclude that you have not touched a woman worthy of that name; which, of course, is only to be expected in this barbaric land. If we ever stop at the Blushing Mermaid in Baldur's Gate, I shall bring you to taste women that would appear as Elven queens compared to this jumped up scarecrow.~
@330  = ~*Shhh...* Save your thanks for later.~
@331  = ~Do you remember my magnanimous offer, <CHARNAME>? Shall you accompany me in visiting the delightful local concubines?~
@332  = ~Sure thing. A company of jolly maidens would be pleasant for a change.~
@333  = ~Why not... if you are paying, that is...~
@334  = ~Edwin, I am distraught by your dishonest proposition!~
@335  = ~Of course, of course. (The things I do for the glory of Thay... Nevron'd better reimburse me this expense.)~
@336  = ~Edwin, how good to see you again, sweety. An'belein is waiting for you as usual.~
@337  = ~As for your guest - <CHARNAME>, is it not? Such a powerful name, if I may say... so manly!~
@338  = ~Here are my most skillful girls:~
@339  = ~Madrina, the proud and tall beauty, not at all frozen like her native Luskan...~
@340  = ~Hello, goooregeous!~
@341  = ~Bhetel, steeped in the heat of Calimshan's sun...~
@342  = ~Here's a man to my likin'...~
@343  = ~And the shy but charming Sveetla...~
@344  = ~H-Hello... You... you are the hero everyone is talking about... aren't you?~
@345  = ~Chose your favorite, <CHARNAME>.~
@346  = ~I have changed my mind. The girls are all beautiful, but I have someone dear to me, I'd rather be with.~
@347  = ~Madrina it is!~
@348  = ~Bhetel it is!~
@349  = ~Sveetla it is!~
@350  = ~You are a strong and handsome man! Let me help you out of these clothes. The bed is right there. O, you are an impatient one!~
@351  = ~Come to Bhetel! Compared to her passion, the Abyss is but a snowflake!~
@352  = ~Th-the rumors exaggerate... your size, sir. *blushes* Not that... size, I mean, they say you're eight feet tall. But I... I am very admiring of you, sir. Let me help you with your clothes. Quite... quite so. Wait till all the girls hear that I had the hero of the Sword Coast... and that he chose me over Marinda and Bhetel... and...~
@353  = ~Sis, the room is occupied.~
@354  = ~*mutters* Of all foul places one could set up a meeting 'tis definitely the most-~
@355  = ~<CHARNAME>???!!!~
@356  = ~Shit.~
@357  = ~Please, do not ask what I am doing. Do not be disillusioned with me on the account of your intelligence.~
@358  = ~It's... It's not what it looks like! I have been... forced! Drugged! Tied up!~
@359  = ~Dear, it's one of Edwin's schemes to separate us. Would you want him to win?~
@360  = ~Dynaheir... er... Meet my aunt Meggy!~
@361  = ~O, I see Madam Nell sent someone else along. Are you new, girl? Join in, dear, I will show you a few tricks.~
@362  = ~Dynaheir... er... Meet my aunt Betty!~
@363  = ~O... I'm sorry, madame, but... but...~
@364  = ~Thou flea-eaten lewdster! *Dynaheir storms away, slamming the door shut behind her.*~
@365  = ~'Tis a night that breaks illusions. Not thine, but mine.~
@366  = ~*dryly* Do not make a clown of thyself. 'Tis not fitting for a hero of the Sword Coast.~
@367  = ~*dryly* Yes, if thou art the prize.~
@368  = ~*giggles* 'Tis Madrina, you incestuous beast!~
@369  = ~*giggles* 'Tis Bhetel, you incestuous beast!~
@370  = ~*giggles* 'Tis Sveetla, you incestuous beast!~
