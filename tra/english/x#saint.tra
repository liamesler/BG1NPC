@0    = ~That was not a particularly good poem. It surprises me that my beauty didn't inspire him to greater heights.~
@1    = ~Miss, I have long ago decided that I should create poetry about the subjects less fleeting than a woman's beauty.~
@2    = ~Darling, you forgot the cardinal rule: always make sure you have more on him than he has on you.~
@3    = ~Little Garrick? How very cute. But I say, if you get yourself a guard dog, get the one which can bite; a big, strong one. They can fetch and dance on their hind legs, as good as the lap variety and even better at times.~
@4    = ~I cannot understand how any woman would want to have a husband and children. I have no time for taking care of anyone but myself... But then again, every matron I met was nowhere nearly as attractive and sophisticated as I am - so maybe they feel that it's pointless?~
@5    = ~Darling, you are not going to drag me through the thicket to rescue this brat, are you? I shudder to think what it can do to my skin...~
@6    = ~Why, of course the Sword Coast is the centre of the universe. At least for now - because that's where I am. You see, darling, I met this absolutely dashing philosopher once, who tried to seduce me with learning. Much of it were silly things, like giving up material wealth for... something; but one was useful. He taught that the only part of the world that exists is the one that rotates around us. I knew it all along, but it was pleasant to see that the sages are finally catching up with me... ~
@7    = ~Darling, that's quite an old strategy to get yourself invited into a company of dashing men - fiercely denying your desire to join. But you picked the wrong man - <CHARNAME> is too... straightforward to understand your little game. ~
@8    = ~Poor thing. I wish we could have returned her to the sea in time.~
@9    = ~That all changes the moment you hold your baby in your arms.~
