@0    = ~So many people always want to speak to you... Why not me? I'm smarter than you are.~
@1    = ~It is nice to be recognised for my importance, for once!~
@2    = ~Stupidity?!? You may have one up over us now, but in the long run, I'll show you who's stupid!~
@3    = ~Silence! Else I shall amuse myself by tearing out your tongue!~
@4    = ~Actually, uh, I think that smell might be me. But I'm glad that you like it!~
@5    = ~Oh! Well, sir, I consider it my duty to help those of less mental fortitude than I, but I'm sure we-~
@6    = ~Hey! Listen to me! Stop paying attention to <CHARNAME>!~
@7    = ~Ha! My guess is he's just jealous of the power, such as I command.~
@8    = ~Hi there!~
@9    = ~The Mermaid and Undercellars, though, it can prove a most ‘educational' place to visit, <CHARNAME>. I'd certainly recommend it if you want to learn some, uh, new tricks.~
@10   = ~Yeah. Somethin' new every day in this place.~
@11   = ~Are you going to ask for my autograph? Say, <CHARNAME>, is he going to ask for my autograph? I get that a lot. Goes with the territory. Mental territory, of course, I don't actually own any land of my own, yet.~
@12   = ~Autograph? Why, yes, sir, but after you've heard out my... proposition.~
@13   = ~Seems everyone's got an errand boy to send messages these days. Say, perhaps I should find myself one... There's enough kids round here, I'm sure people wouldn't miss one or two... Did I say that out loud? You must've been hearing things.~
@14   = ~Sounds like an interesting relationship you have there.~
@15   = ~I'd prefer to think of myself as a mind for hire as opposed to an axe for hire.~
@16   = ~Bah! Are you the new mercenaries, or not?~
@17   = ~Hey there!~
@18   = ~Simple indeed! I could've done something easy as that when I was but knee-high to a gibberling! Of course, I was a very advanced child.~
@19   = ~A reasonable sum, and while, perhaps, not as high as I'd usually charge for my services... I would suggest we accept. <CHARNAME>?~
@20   = ~I am short on time. Will you take the assignment?~
@21   = ~Oh, boy, yes, please!~
@22   = ~Somehow, your odious breath fails to lend credence to your argument, oaf.~
@23   = ~Hey, I'm not his father's child, leave me out of this! I've never even met his father!~
@24   = ~Well, you're certainly right about that one.~
@25   = ~Certainly my type of lady!~
@26   = ~Vagrancy?!? Excuse me! It has been scientifically proven that, uh, sleeping out-of-doors can be beneficial to one's mental prowess! And I am ample proof of that, should you wish to put it to a test, ya big tin-head!~
@27   = ~Eh... Just don't do it again, midget.~
@28   = ~Oh, I completely agree with you! So many louts demand instant answers to all kinds of questions, while the true learned such as myself, know that patience is required, due to the consideration that must be given to each and every variable factor...~
@29   = ~Well, uh, that's my excuse anyway.~
@30   = ~Quite. Nevertheless, I must be off to study my star charts, and rub some lotion on my craned neck. Good fortune in your travels, and may the gods be with you.~
@31   = ~Probably me. Can we play? Let's play.~
@32   = ~Place your bets!~
@33   = ~<CHARNAME>, that means we can make twice as much money as we put in! That's a sure-fire profit! Do you see?~
@34   = ~Take the gnome's wise advice, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~
@35   = ~Such an amazing show! I wonder how he does it. I'm sure I could figure it out one bored afternoon.~
@36   = ~Listen, pal, I'm happy for you, but I don't want to get too close... I don't really go in for that kinda thing. Know what I'm saying?~
@37   = ~What? Oh, you misunderstand. How wonderful to be healthy again!~
@38   = ~I think she should eat less cheese before she goes to bed at night.~
@39   = ~Naturally I know a thing or two about that sort of spell, and he does speak the truth... Only powerful magic will save him. I'd help, of course, but I find those particular spells, uh, give me a headache.~
@40   = ~Are you going to help me, or are we going to stand here and listen to this gnome?~
@41   = ~You have what I need. You've done well.~
@1001 = ~You should go now. He's waiting.~
@1002 = ~Ignore my words at your own peril.~
@43   = ~Bye.~
@44   = ~Now watch closely!~
