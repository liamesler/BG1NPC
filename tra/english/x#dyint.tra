@0    = ~Master Volo? I am delighted to make this acquaintance. Thine 'Guide to the Sword Coast' served me well and true in mine travels.~
@1    = ~Dear lady, I am delighted as well, for I had not expected to meet a fan in this small place.~
@2    = ~Dear lady, I am delighted as well, for I had no expectations of meeting a fan in this small place.~
@3    = ~Mark this young <PRO_MANWOMAN> well, mayor. I sense that 'tis not the last good deed of <PRO_HISHER> thou art hear of.~
@4    = ~So it appears. <CHARNAME>, I like not at all what I see. Dost not let Bhaal overwhelm thee, as he has done with thy brother.~
@5    = ~<CHARNAME>, the man Sarevok is a Spawn of Bhaal, and he hath turned to madness. He must be stopped at all costs!~
@6    = ~Indeed, we can spare a few hours to help thee, good farmer. Is it not so, <CHARNAME>?~
@7    = ~Dost thou have a stone, not a <PRO_RACE>'s heart in thine chest, <CHARNAME>?~
@8    = ~Thou had'st done well in accepting this task, <CHARNAME>.~
@9    = ~O, <CHARNAME>, thou art a noble <PRO_MANWOMAN>!~
@10   = ~Thou only mention theft in thy dishonest task, but in truth thou would make us murderers of Charleston and his men. <CHARNAME> surely would disagree to committing such atrocity.~
@11   = ~I would not be a part of this... enterprise!~
@12   = ~If I wert in the position that thou claim as thine, I would not be quick to accuse innocents.~
@13   = ~Mine advice is... <CHARNAME>, lend thine ear to this child's plea. 'Tis impossible to look at him without pity.~
@14   = ~Sarevok's actions art clumsy, compared to the Red Wizard's politicking, but no less vile.~
@15   = ~Madam, I would have us concentrating on the happenings in Baldur's Gate for now.~
@16   = ~We shalt do our utmost to prevent such an evil thing, Duke Eltan.~
@17   = ~Thou didst good in helping this poor woman. Now we should'st return to our travails.~
@18   = ~Already? I fear we would be late to avert the catastrophy.~
@19   = ~A foul deed must this Ragefast have committed to cause such a strong reaction in someone of a noble descent. 'Tis my experience that they rarely care of the fate of the others. We would do good to make inquiries.~
@20   = ~'Tis vile... so utterly vile! Fire and lightening! I urge thee to... to kill this gnome!~
@21   = ~Kill me? Ha... Some tried, yes, yes... And where are they, precious? Dead.~
@22   = ~'Tis an unexpected turn...~
@23   = ~I would caution thee against hiring thyself as a paid assassin to this woman. Matters like this one should'st not be settled by murder.~
@24   = ~If thou art considering leaving these poor men to their death, thou'd better join them. Death by drowning would be nothing, compared to mine treatment!~
@25   = ~'Tis a very spirited child, but a child nonetheless. I trust that thou hath concluded rightly who is in the wrong here.~
@26   = ~I feel presence of foul enchantment here. I oppose vehemently forcing our way into the houses of goodly folk uninvited, but this one we perhaps should investigate.~
@27   = ~I must apologize for our uncouth intrusion. <CHARNAME>, our purpose here is of no high moral regard. We would'st do better to leave these learned maidens to their studies, and forget of the Alatos' foul request.~
@28   = ~I heard that many an artifact here was made, but by the skillful hands and sharp minds, without the use of magic. Will it ever come to pass that the arcane and technical should'st come to a competition for fulfilling a sentient being's need to do things new and wondrous?~
@29   = ~Well said, m'lady, well said.~
@30   = ~Whene'er I witness the follies of mages who practice in countries that place no demands on their skills, I wonder if idleness inevitably leads great minds to madness?~
@31   = ~Thou would do well to take the advice. It not only cometh from a sage, but I also concede that haste is needed for the peaceful resolution of this grave matter.~
@32   = ~I could not have said better myself, lady.~
@33   = ~Divination is a magic that is rarely practiced in Rashemen. Alas, by need, we place more import on battle spells. If thou would allow this lady to delve thy past and future, I would very much like to see how 'tis done.~
@34   = ~Thou art a mage of considerable learning. Thou should'st remember still the curiosity and ambition of youth, for without, you would not have achieved thy present stature. 'Tis thy responsibility to ensure that thine apprentice hath no access to the magicks beyond his comprehension. Surely, thou could have done better than a weak warding glyph and a padlock!~
@35   = ~Thy master's absentmindedness, however, doth not excuse thy disobedience, Melicamp.~
@36   = ~Go cut cheese with your tongue. Bothering me with advice of all things!~
@37   = ~A Dread Lord? 'Tis not a name I recognize, but with the passing of the lords of strife and murder, the Prince of Lies might well have claimed such a title.~
@38   = ~Answer me!~
@39   = ~Handsome? 'Tis quite shallow, though I suppose that a man of his breeding would possess a certain... dark attractiveness.~
@40   = ~Beware, <CHARNAME>. If those art indeed the Red Wizards of Thay, the truth of which I have no reasons to doubt, they art as skilled in arts arcane as they art devious.~
@41   = ~This accent... is all too familiar. You must be the Rashemi witch spotted in these parts by our friends. I can see that Edwin did not carry out his mission as ordered. Lasala, I suggest that we not tell him that we have done his job. The farther away he is, the less obstructions he creates for us.~
@42   = ~This gnome's hunger for things magical is commendable, but the ways in which he wishes to sate it is not. <CHARNAME>, thou dost not truly command us to this... robbery?~
@43   = ~O, yes, please!~
@44   = ~A mage who uses his knowledge to curse a child is to be condemned! Is there no shred of goodness in thine heart that thou would do such a thing? Thy wife and her lover wronged thee... but thou didst the most vile deed out of the three of ye involved!~
@45   = ~A mage who does not use his knowledge as he pleases is a fool. And I think I know just how I want to apply mine right now!~
@46   = ~'Tis unwise to treat those who would help thee with disrespect. Moreover to threaten them. Or dost thou not wish thy mine cleared of the vermin that plagues it?~
@47   = ~Dost thou know more, my good foreman?~
@48   = ~Little enough, lady. I can tell you this: there's a bunch a mean dog like creatures killin' me men in the mine. Ya gotta stop 'em!~
@49   = ~I am glad that we offered this poor man some small comfort. Though a dagger seems to be a pitiful defense indeed against the evil that I sense is at work here.~
@50   = ~This man is surely distraught! Do find out what is wrong here, <CHARNAME>. Mayhap we can help.~
@51   = ~Take pity on this creature, <CHARNAME>. All it wants is to find its peace. Give it the dagger.~
@52   = ~Atonement, not punishment... Thou art a wise man, Nalin. As wise as any Othlor in my land. I trust that thou hast learnt a valuable lesson about justice today, <CHARNAME>.~
@53   = ~Thou art seeing it all in the stars, my good man?~
@54   = ~Yes, my lady.~
@55   = ~Then thy sight is sharp indeed.~
@56   = ~Quite so, m'lady. Well, it has been a pleasure to chat with someone who appreciates my art. Nevertheless, I must be off to study my star charts and rub some lotion on my craned neck. Good fortune in your travels, and may the gods be with you.~
@57   = ~It appears that we had interrupted a tryst, and now we stand to slaughter an innocent man because thou hast scared the girl. A dear price for thy flirting, <CHARNAME>.~
@58   = ~'Twas nobly done, <CHARNAME>.~
@59   = ~Now I wonder just why he had taken thee for someone who practice a disreputable trade. It must be something in thy character that showed through.~
@60   = ~<CHARNAME>, I am not pleased with thy handling of this matter. This poor man was cursed, and his torment upon his recovery was genuine. Thou should have found a just and merciful man to surrender him to.~
@61   = ~These emeralds will be everywhere out of place, and forever dull. Unless they art again made whole with the marvelous statue that Prism had carved.~
@62   = ~There is a saying in Rashemen: 'It takes two fools to start a fight.'~
@63   = ~Dost not take his words lightly, <CHARNAME>. I sense power about him; he is indeed a mighty magician.~
@64   = ~'Tis not the ogre I find frightening; 'tis the persistence of those who sent him.~
@65   = ~This tale must be dark indeed, if she asks for a reward. The foul tales art enough and to spare in this land, and art told freely to every passerby who would listen.~
@66   = ~I am grieved, for I foresee that 'tis as thou fear: the spiders do not keep prisoners. Yet, I myself was a captive of no less vicious critters and survived a while before <CHARNAME> came to the rescue.~
@67   = ~'Tis a sad lesson that every young adventurer learns eventually. Being brave doth not make one invincible.~
@68   = ~So, thou style thyself an enemy of the Iron Throne openly now? Well, one cannot hide all in a sack, I suppose, so mayhap 'tis for the best.~
@69   = ~Insulting this knight was ill done, <CHARNAME>.~
@70   = ~This squire knight looks trustworthy. Why, he reminds me of my loyal Minsc. He will be a valuable addition to this group.~
@71   = ~I am starting to wonder *whose* haleness of mind I need doubt. *The look she gives you speaks volumes of the torment of a woman who deems herself intelligent, whose sworn sword chats regularly to a giant space hamster, and who believes that she's just witnessed her leader ask a xvart, a kobold and a tasloi for an autograph.*~
@72   = ~Thank thee for the gift, astrologer, and for the forewarning of the battle to come.~
@73   = ~'Tis not a just punishment. Enchantments of that sort are not toys to hurl around like a child throwing a tantrum. I urge thee to free these rogues, <CHARNAME>.~
@74   = ~<CHARNAME>, thou really should'st consider that acting like a common thief doth not become thee. I do not like using my arts to slay honest men.~
@75   = ~*sighs* I would hear no end of it, but could thou break into the house, <CHARNAME> and... appropriate the ring?~
@76   = ~*sighs* I would hear no end of it, but could we break into the house, <CHARNAME> and... appropriate the ring?~
@77   = ~I wish that thou didst not resort to robbery of innocent people, <CHARNAME>.~
@78   = ~Tread with care, <CHARNAME>, and dost not kill small crawling things. The local legend hath it that not all folk of Firewine had perished in the magical surge that hath destroyed their town. Some, they say wert transformed into such creatures as slugs or lizards...~
@79   = ~What magical surge?~
@80   = ~Well, much as I would not want to kill a prominent elf turned turtle... I am not a pixie to move without touching the ground.~
@81   = ~Is there hard evidence to support this claim?~
@82   = ~I am surprised that thou dost not know the history of thine own land. Firewine was destroyed in a duel between two powerful mages. Their spells wert so potent, and so wild, that they leveled the unfortunate town and turned the river's course away. Now, naught but rubble remains as a reminder to those of mine profession not to exercise their talents for childish strife. For a foul play can turn into a tragedy.~
@83   = ~I am aware that thou art not a fey, but do exercise caution...~
@84   = ~'Tis in thine own interest.~
@85   = ~The locals say that a lass from Gullykin once freed a wizard by accident and ended up marrying him.~
@86   = ~It could have been worse, I suppose.~
@87   = ~I abhor helping thee in such carnage! Thou wilt not use my debt to thee again, to compel me to serve as a thief's assassin.~
@88   = ~Here stands the Keep which asks a traveler to pay for entry with knowledge, not golden coin... Indeed, I can only envy thee, <CHARNAME>, for thou hast grown in such a place of enlightenment. I wish greatly that I had time to study the collections.~
@89   = ~What hath happened here is a lesson for every charlatan who doth not show proper respect to the Arts magical.~
@90   = ~But what do I see? You are not quite as useless as I have reported to Nevron time and again. You are worse! What part of "kill" did you not understand when you were ordered to assassinate the Rashemi witch? Has the stay in these barbaric lands softened your wits?~
@91   = ~Au contraire, my most illustrious Denak. (Flattery never hurts...) The cleverest, the most powerful, and infinitely wise Denak... I have devised a scheme worthy of thy most exquisite intellect. Indulge my most unworthy self a moment, and I will explain...~
@92   = ~*sighs* Let me guess - instead of killing the witch, you have captured her for questioning?~
@93   = ~I knew that a man of your vast abilities would take but a moment to see to the core of my cunning ruse.~
@94   = ~I would stand in as this overambitious youngling's prisoner for a few minutes, if that would spare us a battle. But I would *not* hand myself over to his ilk!~
@95   = ~And did you think how wasteful it is to transport a prisoner back to Thay?~
@96   = ~Er... I have foreseen that, of course. I have questioned the witch... most severely, and learned all that is to know from her. I only brought the wretch here to er... ask if... if Nevron's orders did not change in regards to her, and so that my most distinguished commanders could partake in the executions of the witch and her collaborators. (Now, that is the answer of a true genius!)~
@97   = ~Wait a minute! Edwin... I am not-~
@98   = ~Right. I knew it was too good to last. I guess we will have to kill these wizards. The question is, whether you are with us or against us, Edwin.~
@99   = ~He is lying through his teeth! I admit I refused to kill her, as Edwin suggested. That I rescued her and she travels now as my companion is also true. However, I know nothing of the feud between you.~
@100  = ~Tsk, tsk, Edwin... such a joker you are! You know I came here to make sure the witch is killed in a way that will bring the most glory to Thay. Is not that right?~
@101  = ~... ready to die? Simian, who asked you?~
@102  = ~A Red Wizard of Thay serves the glory of Thay... or his own elevation. To one who was born to unify all of Thay under his rule, it is obviously one and the same goal. No matter how pathetically inadequate you are to do my bidding, <CHARNAME>, I find my so called superiors to be inferior even to a chattering simian from a barbaric land. You will obviously need my help to destroy them... (And then I will be free to plan without constantly being scrutinized and belittled by these petty bureaucrats.)~
@103  = ~Why, simian, is there even a question in your mind?~
@104  = ~Why, I should not even have to strain myself excessively with the paperwork... Nevron is a fool, and will swallow any likely tale...~
@105  = ~I find that difficult to believe. Edwin, do prove yourself useful and help me take care of this... motley crew.~
@106  = ~Quite amusing, Edwin. Once a new assignment for you has been received, I will contact you. Oh... and here is your reimbursement as per your last expense report, though I am still unclear as to how buying a drow pleasure slave helped you in the capture of the witch?~
@107  = ~Edwin, your rugged companion here awaits your answer. Do you concede to having the most pathetic sense of humor this side of the Spine of the World, or will you expose <PRO_HISHER> primitive attempt at a ruse?~
@108  = ~My breathtakingly clever superior can surely see that one has to elevate the spirits of his barbaric underlings. The joke was for the simians that accompany me, not your noble ears. Now, to prove our fealty, we will slay the witch in a most exemplary fashion...~
@109  = ~This is how thou repay me for my loyalty, <CHARNAME>?~
@110  = ~I certainly hope you are right!~
@111  = ~Thank you for answering a mother's plea.~
@112  = ~It's all I've got, and I'm grateful for it. Thanks.~
@113  = ~Jamie, don't let them hurt me!~
@114  = ~Eh? Never mind. Here's your fee, Greywolf.~
@115  = ~You've surrendered him to lawful justice. The people of this town will sleep easier knowing he's no longer a threat.~
@116  = ~Now, Prism took what wasn't rightfully his, so they'll sparkle just as well in hands of their rightful owner.~
@117  = ~And that would be you and <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@118  = ~Very true! Too bad you won't live to spread the word.~
@119  = ~Poor Chelak!~
@120  = ~Take this, and prove your intentions by your deeds.~
@121  = ~Perhaps my lady will come to regret her association with such ill-mannered folk.~
@122  = ~Thank you, my lady. I strive to serve with vigilance and with honor.~
@123  = ~Hey, lady, you in the robes - you want one, too?~
@124  = ~In helping you, I help myself. I do not desire that these dreams should persist.~
@125  = ~Should have thought of that before you tore up the place.~
@1001 = ~Every little bit helps!~
@1002 = ~Haalp meeee!~
@1003 = ~Did you say something? Never mind... have a good <DAYNIGHT>.~
@1004 = ~Hm, perhaps, but you did the right thing returning them to their lawful owner.~
@1005 = ~But it is done. Begone!~
@1006 = ~That's two R's... and here you go!~
@1007 = ~Don't mention it. I serve myself as well as you.~
@1008 = ~Should have thought of that before!~
