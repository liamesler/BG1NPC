@0    = ~What do you wish of me? I do not have much time or inclination for talk.~
@1    = ~Hmmm... you look worried. Is there any way I can help you?~
@2    = ~Oh, nothing. Just chatting.~
@3    = ~OK, but it could have been a free drink for you... you are kind of cute, y'know.~
@4    = ~Yep, same thing you said last time. Are you a relative of a guy named 'Noober'?~
@5    = ~Your purse looks heavy. How about handing it over.~
@6    = ~*blanches* You again... I have no money. Please, just leave me alone.~
@7    = ~Hmmm... you look worried. Look, sorry we scared you, we were just joking. Is there any way I can help you?~
@8    = ~Oh, fine. You don't look rich enough anyways.~
@9    = ~Unless you can find a small gnome with an attitude problem the size of Waterdeep, you cannot help me.~
@10   = ~A strange gnome

I encountered an enigmatic gnome. He seems to be looking for another gnome not presently in my company. Perhaps it would be worth my while to return if I meet one matching his description.~
@11   = ~Ahhh. Perhaps we will speak again later. It should not be too hard to find a small one with a big attitude - they all seem to have large personalities.~
@12   = ~Well, that was a waste of time. Let's go.~
@13   = ~I don't think we are communicating clearly. The way this works is that I help you, you give me your purse. I don't help you, you give me your purse. Either way, you give me your purse.~
@14   = ~What about this gnome right here?~
@15   = ~Hmmm... this is more than you said during our last conversation, but I could use more information.~
@16   = ~well, obviously I am not getting through to you. I will go see if I can find a gnome and try this whole thing again.~
@17   = ~I have no interest in small talk.~
@18   = ~Because I am a gnome? Never mind. I am not interested in idle banter, or free drinks.~
@19   = ~There! Have my pathetic fortune. Are you satisfied? Now leave me be.~
@20   = ~Yeah, yeah. We keep it in our noses. Move along.~
@21   = ~Don't let me stop you.~
@22   = ~I haven't got anything to say to you until you bring me the gnome I seek.~
@23   = ~Wrong gnome. *sigh*. I will be around if you find another one, though.~
@24   = ~Were you implying that my attitude is somehow more prominent than my knowledge? Perhaps I should take insult.~
@25   = ~A strange gnome

I encountered an enigmatic gnome. He seems to be looking for another gnome not presently in my company. Perhaps it would be worth my while to return if I meet one matching his description.~
@26   = ~No matter. Perhaps we will find someone to bring back here later.~
@27   = ~There is a strange one. We may be able to find someone to help him later.~
@28   = ~There is a strange one. He did not appear to have enough gold to be useful. We may be able to find someone to help him later.~
@29   = ~There is a strange one. He might be sport for our blades, but perhaps we can turn more profit by finding the gnome he seeks.~
@30   = ~Perhaps I can distract you from your troubles, friend. If you would just hand me your purse? You would find me most appreciative... and retain your skin whole and undamaged.~
@31   = ~I think he was talking about a specific person rather than just any gnome... but no matter. Perhaps we will find someone to bring back here later.~
@32   = ~I think he was talking about another of us, Quayle... but no matter. Perhaps we will find someone to bring back here later.~
@33   = ~Whatever. I've got better things to do.~
@34   = ~If I remember.~
@35   = ~By Baervan! It cannot be! Either I've been driven mad in addition to all my other ailments, or Baervan himself must have bestowed his greatest blessing upon me! Telliax? Is that really you!?~
@36   = ~Tiax demands that you stop slobbering in his face, slave! Stand aside! Tiax will tolerate no impediment to his passage!~
@37   = ~'Tiax'? What are you blathering about, boy? Come with me! You're my only chance to get these blasted bounty hunters off my tail!~
@38   = ~Excuse me, sir? Just who are you, and why are you calling Tiax by that name?~
@39   = ~So, is this the right gnome, then?~
@40   = ~Who are you? We have places to be, and you're making no sense.~
@41   = ~That gnome's name is Tiax, not Telliax. You must have the wrong person.~
@42   = ~Like the gnome said, get out of our way or we'll slaughter you where you stand. We have no time for this.~
@43   = ~Hey, you have a lot of nerve - you ran away last time we met.~
@44   = ~I don't know who you are, young <PRO_MANWOMAN>, but I don't have time for this! The ones hunting me are in this very city, and this boy is my only hope.~
@45   = ~The one you're calling 'Tiax' is my former apprentice, and his real name is 'Telliax'. Unless he comes with me and proves that he's still alive, I'm done for! I'll be dragged back to Amn and hung like a common criminal, for a crime I didn't even commit!~
@46   = ~Slow down! If you're being unjustly pursued, we'll help you, so please explain what you're talking about.~
@47   = ~You'll have to make time, old man. I won't have you taking away my companion without explaining yourself.~
@48   = ~This meeting has grown tiresome. Away with you, and pester us no longer if you value your life.~
@49   = ~My eyes have gone bad lately, young <PRO_MANWOMAN>, but not so bad that I don't recognize my travelling companion of several years.~
@50   = ~This boy's name is 'Telliax', and he was my apprentice in the worship of Baervan Wildwanderer. I have no time for long conversation, either. Unless Telliax comes with me, I'm as good as dead!~
@51   = ~Your apprentice? Please, explain yourself further. If your need is genuine, we'll be happy to aid you.~
@52   = ~In case you didn't notice, our diminutive little friend here does NOT worship Baervan Wildwanderer. He worships Cyric.~
@53   = ~Enough. Leave now before we're forced to gut you where you stand. We have no time for this idiocy.~
@54   = ~No, please! You must listen to me, you must... help me! I beg of you; without his aid, I'm a dead man!~
@55   = ~So the mad one drags us into another distraction. Kill them both, and let us move on.~
@56   = ~Let me kill him. Either one. I mean, just for practice. Can I?~
@57   = ~Don't be silly, Montaron... you mean "may I?"~
@58   = ~Yes, yes... may I?~
@59   = ~Well... alright, old man, tell us what you have to say. However, you had best explain yourself quickly!~
@60   = ~Apparently you've lost your hearing in your old age. Move or die, you old fool! You won't receive a third warning!~
@61   = ~Apparently you are just not listening. My friends here think killing you for your insolence should be entertaining. I would move along, if I were you... ~
@62   = ~I tire of this. I am going to kill you now. If I were you, would run.~
@63   = ~Some gnome named Belgin the Wanderer bothered us today; I helped him learn that unwanted intrusions are for fools and dead men. I am sure that he will not be bothering us again.~
@64   = ~But... ahh, very well. I will explain myself, but afterwards I beg of you to to aid me!~
@65   = ~Cyric!? What in the hells has happened to you, boy!?~
@66   = ~Tiax has seen the light... er, darkness of the Black Sun! Tiax's rule of all shall be ensured by the almighty Cyric, master of everything! Tiax's armies shall lay waste to the land and his enemies shall cringe at the sight of his banner! All praise to Tiax, greatest servant of Cyric and ruler of all!~
@67   = ~What is this nonsense!? Telliax, I knew you were an arrogant twit, but by Baervan you're ranting like a madman! Bah, what does it matter!? Insane or not, the fact that you're still breathing will save me! Come! We have no time to spare!~
@68   = ~Please, explain yourself. If you require aid, ask us. We're willing to help if your cause is just.~
@69   = ~He's going nowhere until we get some answers. What are you talking about? Speak quickly!~
@70   = ~Get away from us, old man, or face the consequences! We have no time for you.~
@71   = ~Damn you! Damn your black soul to the hells for all eternity! I will not be killed for a crime I didn't commit, and I'll find a way to show those bounty hunters that this blasted idiot is still alive, I swear on Baervan's name.~
@72   = ~Some gnome named Belgin the Wanderer bothered us today. I helped him learn that unwanted intrusions are for fools and dead men. He ran away blathering that he will prove that someone named 'Telliax' isn't dead. I am sure that he will not be bothering us again.~
@73   = ~My name is Belgin, known as Belgin the Wanderer, priest of Baervan Wildwanderer. This gnome that you know as 'Tiax' is actually named Telliax. He's the privileged son of an Athakatlan merchant, but his privilege landed him in a bit of trouble.~
@74   = ~You may have noted young Telliax's thieving skills? Well, for no other reason than his own boredom, he just happened to try and develop those skills along the Athkatlan docks...~
@75   = ~... Which just happens to have upset the Shadow Thieves, one of the most powerful organizations in the city! They demanded he join their organization or die, so his father turned to *me* to help tutor him in the ways of my god and get him out of the city. I had no idea what a trial I was in for.~
@76   = ~Bah! This tale is fanciful nonsense! Tiax was born from Cyric himself, unleashed upon this world to bend it to his will and bring fear to the hearts of his enemies! Tiax has no use for merchants and their useless trinkets, nor does he fear any petty thieves! Away with ye, old man, 'lest you join the long list who will pay when Tiax rules all!~
@77   = ~Change the name and add a healthy dose of insanity, and the personality apparently remains the same, alas. This little brat was the most obnoxious apprentice I ever tutored! He was arrogant, whiny, and spoiled! None of our travelling accomodations or rations were ever up to his standards. He addressed me as 'commoner' and routinely reminded me of how inferior I was to him due to my lack of wealth.~
@78   = ~By the end, I was feeling the sore temptation to wring his scrawny neck myself, though thank Baervan it never came to that. As we travelled with a caravan, we were ambushed by bandits. I escaped, Telliax didn't, so I naturally assumed they killed him.~
@79   = ~Tiax, stopped by mere bandits!? BAH! What stupidity! Tiax thinks you've been driven mad, old ma...~
@80   = ~...~
@81   = ~Tiax... is having a hard time remembering...~
@82   = ~Bandits? Cyric? Tiax... remembers the black altar...~
@83   = ~Apparently something is seeping through that thick head of his. I don't know what happened after the bandits attacked, but as you might suspect I wasn't too keen on taking them on single-handedly, even if I was more fond of the lad. I'm a man of humble means, so I moved on with my life. Unfortunately, Telliax's father didn't move on with his.~
@84   = ~Knowing his son's rather... grating personality, he's dispatched bounty hunters to capture me for Telliax's murder! They wish to bring me back to Amn for a sham trial, no doubt, after which they'll hang me! I did nothing wrong, yet I doubt anything I could say would ever be believed! I've been forced to run from this group, and they've been nipping at my heels for months now! Please, you must help me!~
@85   = ~A very interesting story. Of course we'll help you.~
@86   = ~What's in it for us?~
@87   = ~We can help, but give us some time. We're busy at the moment.~
@88   = ~Your story rings false. Scamper away, fool, before we run you through.~
@89   = ~Wanted, eh? Hmmm... and how much will you give us just to keep your little secret?~
@90   = ~Oh....  of course I'll pay you. I offer 500 gold for your silence right now, and 2000 more if you help me clear my name. Please, just go to the Blade and Stars tavern! Baervan has revealed to me that they're staying there, planning to scour the city for me! Hurry, I beg of you! I'll be at the Helm and Cloak when you've convinced them, with your payment.~
@91   = ~That sounds worthwile. We'll do it.~
@92   = ~Give us the 500 gold now, and we will think about it.~
@93   = ~We can help, but give us some time. We're busy at the moment. We will take the "downpayment." Now.~
@94   = ~Well well well, 500 gold. It is too much work to run your errand, but the gold will be very useful. We will take it, and then you should run.~
@95   = ~Damn you! Damn your black soul to the hells for all eternity! I will not be killed for a crime I didn't commit, and I'll find a way to show those bounty hunters that this blasted idiot is still alive, I swear on Baervan's name. Take your damned coin, and may the gods curse you forever!~
@96   = ~Devious, <CHARNAME>. A game within a game, perhaps? I could have just stolen his gold, you know...~
@97   = ~We could follow him quickly and dispose of him. I do not want any loose ends.~
@98   = ~Killing him now would be a waste of time. I could use better specimens. Perhaps these bounty hunters will help us with that.~
@99   = ~I... I... *sigh* I had better not write this one down, right?~
@100  = ~I compliment you on a game well played, both ends against the middle! Let us find these bounty hunters and wring the last profit from Belgin's sorry blood!~
@101  = ~Weaklings never prosper. The strong prey on the weak. Belgin should never had asked the lion to protect him, without first finding out if the lion was hungry...~
@102  = ~Too much talk for too little coin. Let's go.~
@103  = ~A textbook double cross. Excellent.  (The simian is trainable after all. Perhaps I can mold him to my own advantage.)~
@104  = ~Truly, a worthy twist. Are you sure that no dark elven blood flows in you veins? The subject was worthless, but the game was very entertaining. We should play with these bounty hunters quickly, before Belgin gets far.~
@105  = ~This is pointless and distracting. If we must meet these hunters, let us do so quickly.~
@106  = ~I've helped a man named Belgin the Wanderer learn that loose tounges are for fools and dead men. He ran away blathering that he will prove that 'Telliax', his apprentice and erstwhile companion, isn't dead. He's being hunted by bounty hunters; this should provide some additional coin. They're staying at the Blade and Stars. I am sure they will pay well for information on Belgin's whereabouts. If not, perhaps we will have some sport...~
@107  = ~Here is all I have right now. I will go get the rest, and be at the Helm and Cloak, awaiting word.~
@108  = ~Weaklings never prosper. The strong prey on the weak. Belgin should never have asked the lion to protect him, without first finding out if the lion was hungry...~
@109  = ~Too much talk for too little gold. Let's go get th' hunter's money, an' then come back and get more of this rabbit's coin.~
@110  = ~Silly dwarf, he has no more gold... look at his clothes, and how he turned white at <CHARNAME>'s play! Although it might not hurt to find out if he has any more, I suppose.~
@111  = ~A textbook double cross. Excellent.  (The simian is trainable after all. Perhaps I can mold him to my own advantage.)~
@112  = ~I've helped a man named Belgin the Wanderer learn that loose tounges are for fools and dead men. He's being hunted by bounty hunters, which should provide some additional coin. They're staying at the Blade and Stars. I am sure they will pay well for information on Belgin's whereabouts. If not, perhaps we will have some sport... Belgin claimed to have more coin on the completion. Perhaps we can play all sides of this.~
@113  = ~Baervan bless your souls! All you must do is find the bounty hunters. Baervan has revealed to me, through the blessing of a spell of divination, that they're staying at the Blade and Stars tavern. Please, I beg of you, don't harm them! Simply show them Tiax so that they'll leave me be once and for all! Come back, and I will pay you 1000 gold for your kind deed. Thank you! Bless you! I'll be at the Helm and Cloak when you've managed to convince them.~
@114  = ~I've agreed to help a man named Belgin the Wanderer prove that 'Telliax,' his apprentice and erstwhile companion, isn't dead. He's being hunted by bounty hunters, and I need Tiax with me to convince the bounty hunters he's still alive. They're staying at the Blade and Stars.~
@115  = ~Well, of course I'll pay you. My life is worth more than coin, so if your interests are purely mercenary, have no fear. I offer 1000 gold for the deed, though, alas, I have no more to give. Please, just go to the Blade and Stars tavern. Baervan has revealed to me that they're staying there, planning to scour the city for me! Hurry, I beg of you! I'll be at the Helm and Cloak when you've convinced them, with your payment.~
@116  = ~Very well, but when you get some time please help me! There will be a 1000 gold reward for your aid, should you help. The bounty hunters should be staying at the Blade and Stars tavern, so please seek them out as soon as possible! When you've convinced them to leave me be, come to the Helm and Cloak and you will be rewarded.~
@117  = ~What do you say? Were you successful in clearing my name?~
@118  = ~I have been waiting anxiously for word for days now.~
@119  = ~I do not see Telliax with you. I hope that everything was resolved.~
@120  = ~I am sorry to report that nothing will sway Karris. He is on his way here as we speak. For 1000 gold, we will delay him for you...~
@121  = ~We have not met with Karris, and have no intention of doing so. I think you can keep yourself safe by giving us 2000 gold, and we will say we never met you.~
@122  = ~Oh, we met with Karris, and came to an arrangement. He subcontracted out your demise. Unless, of course, you are able to make it worth our while to look the other way.~
@123  = ~We met Karris, and killed him. You have nothing to fear now. Unless, of course, you do not pay us.~
@124  = ~We met with Karris and cleared your name. You are safe.~
@125  = ~Your miserable life was worth 2000 gold, as I recall. Do you dare renegotiate that bargain?~
@126  = ~Well, Tiax has had a vision granted by Cyric. I am afraid it is not a pleasant end for you, Belgin.~
@127  = ~This is not what we agreed to! I asked you to help me.~
@128  = ~Now I will have to run for my life for Telliax and for arranging the death of the bounty hunters sent after me!~
@129  = ~You have already taken all that I have. I have no more to give.~
@130  = ~Given how we met, I am prepared for your doublecross. I am glad that my name is cleared, because now I can return to my Patron with word of your nature. Beware visiting Amn, <CHARNAME>... I will make sure word of your deeds preceeds you.~
@131  = ~Well, friend Belgin, there is always a price to be paid for help of any kind.~
@132  = ~You have already taken all that I have. I have little more to give, but what I have is yours.~
@133  = ~The Guild dues to kill you would have been prohibitive anyways. Perhaps you have something material to give us for our time?~
@134  = ~You attempted to rob me and then blackmailed me, but you did finally deliver. I should be grateful, I suppose... here is everything I own.~
@135  = ~You should be grateful. It is not often the lion helps the lamb without expecting a hearty meal afterwards.~
@136  = ~Regardless of what our agreement was, what is done is done. You promised a reward, and I expect you to deliver.~
@137  = ~It could not be helped. The bounty hunters are no longer troubling you, and that fulfills our part of the bargain.~
@138  = ~Fine. Safana, kill him.~
@139  = ~Fine. Montaron, here is your new toy. Kill him when you have finished playing.~
@140  = ~Fine. Xzar, have you ever found out what sound a liver landing on the floor makes? Could you please demonstrate?~
@141  = ~Fine. Garrick, kill him.~
@142  = ~Fine. Eldoth, kill him.~
@143  = ~Fine. Faldorn, kill him.~
@144  = ~Fine. Kagain, kill him.~
@145  = ~Fine. Edwin, kill him.~
@146  = ~Fine. Tiax, kill him.~
@147  = ~Fine. Viconia, he is yours. Kill him. Slowly.~
@148  = ~Fine. Shar-Teel, kill him.~
@149  = ~Bah. So you did. Begone!~
@150  = ~There has been enough death. I am done with it. Take your life, and go.~
@151  = ~Oh, very well. Go.~
@152  = ~Cyric says he dies!~
@153  = ~But this cannot be! I have little to offer, and am of no threat to you!~
@154  = ~Telliax, wakeup! You must remember me... please...~
@155  = ~Bah! Kneel, slave, and prepare to die for the glory of CYRIC!~
@156  = ~(This might actually be amusing.)~
@157  = ~This may be amusing, but it is not artful. Let me play with him awhile. The mad one, be he god or insane gnome, does not need this sacrifice.~
@158  = ~I really, really want his ears!~
@159  = ~Baervan preserve me! I beg you, do not do this!~
@160  = ~Ah, isn't that nice. A prayer to your god before death. Quite fitting, actually. Except perhaps you should have prayed to me.~
@161  = ~Well Tiax, he is your mentor. Your call.~
@162  = ~Nice final words, but I am sure you will be saying a few more before you are gone. Viconia, he is yours. Kill him. Slowly.~
@163  = ~Belgin, you just don't seem to understand Gallows humor. Of course we are not going to kill you. Just give me the coin and let's be done with this.~
@164  = ~I appreciate what you have done here. I can go back to my life, and for that I am grateful.~
@165  = ~Given how we met, I was prepared for you to doublecross me. I am glad that you chose to help, instead.~
@166  = ~The Guild dues to kill you would have been prohibitive anyways. Perhaps you have something material to give us for our time? Your ears really do look like collectables.~
@167  = ~A pleasure doing business with you.~
@168  = ~I am glad we could help you.~
@169  = ~Business is concluded. Now we'll just kill you for fun.~
@170  = ~Yeah, as long as it's over. Get lost.~
@171  = ~If you want anything, you have to talk to the boss.~
@172  = ~Hey, we're working, here. Go talk to the boss.~
@173  = ~Hail, adventurer. I am busy right now. After we have settled ourselves, I will gladly speak with you.~
@174  = ~Well, I was going to say you were cute and offer to buy you a round, but obviously you are not interested.~
@175  = ~Hmmm... that's what you said last time.~
@176  = ~Yep, very repetitive. Are you a relative of a guy named "Noober"?~
@177  = ~Fair enough. We will be around Baldur's Gate for a few days, but will check back in later.~
@178  = ~No chance. We are headed out of Baldur's Gate for adventure. ~
@179  = ~I will be back. Perhaps you would be less dismissive if you realized that I can drop you where you stand without breaking a sweat.~
@180  = ~That's right. I'm not.~
@181  = ~Are you a slow learner?~
@182  = ~Never heard of him.~
@183  = ~Suit yourself.~
@184  = ~If you say so.~
@185  = ~Yes? What is it now?~
@186  = ~We have an unfinished issue to discuss, I'm afraid.~
@187  = ~We've come to offer you information on the whereabouts of your prey, Belgin. For a little compensation, of course.~
@188  = ~So sorry, but we've come to kill you. I'd suggest standing still. It will be a lot less messy that way, and the Innkeep might complain if we get blood on his nice clean floor.~
@189  = ~Hail, friends! You've the look of adventurers or mercenaries about you. Well met! My name is Karris, recently of Amn. Who are you, if you don't mind me asking?~
@190  = ~Another careless surfacer helping others, I suppose. All this benevolence sickens me. Tell him nothing, <CHARNAME>.~
@191  = ~Stop your sniveling, <CHARNAME>, and let us gut this useless male like a fish.~
@192  = ~This one will be good sport. Let me have his ears.~
@193  = ~Noooo! No discussion! <CHARNAME>, you promised me the ears and the eyes this time!~
@194  = ~Too much talk. Just kill this worthless male and be done with it. His gear will be useful.~
@195  = ~Hail, Karris! My name is <CHARNAME>, recently of CandleKeep. I believe we may have an issue to discuss.~
@196  = ~I'm afraid I must skip the pleasantries, Karris. We have an important issue to discuss.~
@197  = ~I do mind you asking. I have no intentions of revealing my name to a lowly thug for hire.~
@198  = ~I have come to collect the bounty for killing Belgin. I did the deed myself. I guess he was a little worried about you capturing him - he died easily enough.~
@199  = ~Sorry, Karris, but we have more important things to do than chat with our victims. It's time for you to die.~
@200  = ~An issue? Very well, then. Speak your mind.~
@201  = ~His ears and eyes, remember... mine.~
@202  = ~Quiet, Xzar, ye get yer spoils soon enough. Let <CHARNAME> work.~
@203  = ~We've sought you out on the behalf of a gnome named Belgin, who you are pursuing unjustly. He commited no crime, and we can prove it.~
@204  = ~We're here on the behalf of Belgin, the gnome you've hounded and tormented. We suggest you leave him be. He didn't commit the crime he is accused of, and we can prove it.~
@205  = ~Forget it. The more I think about it, the less I want to get involved in this whole mess.~
@206  = ~We've discovered the whereabouts of the gnome you've been hunting. In exchange for a little gold on the side, we can tell you where he is. And in exchange for a little more gold, you will find only a body.~
@207  = ~In exchange for a little gold on the side, we can tell you where the gnome you've been hunting is hiding.~
@208  = ~We've sought you out to ask how you would like to spend your final minutes on this world. Would you prefer screaming as we gut you alive, or flailing about shrieking as we set you ablaze?~
@209  = ~If that's how you wish it to be, then so be it. Good day and goodbye.~
@210  = ~To arms, friends! We have berserkers in our midst!~
@211  = ~Time for collection!~
@212  = ~See, ye great nit, spoils await.~
@213  = ~err, oh... battle! Wait one second while I...~
@214  = ~A waste of time. The mageling is mine. (I will have to finish the rest of them off anyways - why do I suffer these incompetents?~
@215  = ~Tiax will rule YOU!~
@216  = ~Finally, some bloodsport. I will kill you slowly.~
@217  = ~Play briskly with the others, but leave the leader to me.~
@218  = ~I met the bounty hunters tracking Karris and attacked them. I doubt Belgin will be happy, but I felt it was an appropriate solution.~
@219  = ~So, you know why we're here, then. My apologies, but our duty is clear. Belgin was given charge of an apprentice, and was responsible for his safety. There is no proof, as of yet, that he murdered his charge, but nonetheless the untimely disappearance of Telliax warrants enough suspicion that Belgin must be brought back to Athkatla for questioning.~
@220  = ~Telliax's father was very clear on the matter. We are not to harm Belgin, but neither can we allow him to walk away untouched from what appears to be cold-blooded murder.~
@221  = ~Belgin never harmed Telliax. In fact, no one did. He's perfectly fine physically, if a bit insane.~
@222  = ~This is lunacy. Telliax isn't dead. He's perfectly fine, aside from his insanity.~
@223  = ~Well, I tried my best. Since you intend to continue your hunt, how about we lead you to your quarry in exchange for some gold?~
@224  = ~I tried to make you see reason, but obviously some people only understand the edge of a sword. Time to die, Karris.~
@225  = ~You may be required to wait for trial, but I am not. Perhaps you could hire us to take care of your problem - a subcontract, without having to pay any guild fees?~
@226  = ~I am afraid you will be wasting your time. Belgin has been killed.~
@227  = ~Very well then, I suppose. Good day to you.~
@228  = ~You know Belgin's location!? Ah, that will save us much time and effort! He's been astonishingly elusive prey. I'll tell you what: I'll give you 1500 gold in exchange for all you know. It's quite a sum for merely giving us a location, I'm sure you'll agree. Take it or leave it. I don't have the time or the inclination to haggle.~
@229  = ~But then I cannot use his parts... ~
@230  = ~Are you carrying that gold with you now? <CHARNAME>, perhaps these bounty hunters need to unburden themselves of so much weight. It can be dangerous to carry such a load. It has even proven fatal.~
@231  = ~(Simians.) <CHARNAME>, either kill these insects or take their gold. Better yet, both.~
@232  = ~This man is right. Nature does not haggle. She acts. If we are stronger, we should kill this man and take what Nature rightfully grants us. If we are equals, let us take this gold and move on.~
@233  = ~Ooooh... no maore battles, please. Can't we just take the money and go?~
@234  = ~Shut up, Skie. Do not presume to speak while <CHARNAME> is working.~
@235  = ~We could always remove the problem for you, for perhaps 2000 gold? The Guild would charge far more...~
@236  = ~I'll take it! Go to the Helm and Cloak. He's waiting for news of our success there.~
@237  = ~I'll leave it. Goodbye, Karris. Have fun scouring the city.~
@238  = ~Look,this is silly. Tiax, err... I mean "Telliax," is definitely, completely, thoroughly alive. And very, very annoying.~
@239  = ~I am sorry, but I'll require something more substantial than your word. If Telliax is indeed still alive, bring him to me. He's been described in careful detail by his father. Until then, we have nothing to talk about.~
@240  = ~Insane!? Who would DARE to mock Tiax to his very face!? Surely ye must long to have your limbs yanked from their sockets to taunt fate so! Cyric demands payment for all insults directed against his champion, and Tiax *will* collect!~
@241  = ~It can't be! By the gods, you mean to say *this* is our employer's son, Telliax!? What's happened to him? The description matches, though he appears a bit more... unkempt than I would have imagined for a rich merchant's son.~
@242  = ~Alas, he seems to have suffered some sort of unknown trauma. When we discovered him, he was babbling about conquering the world in the name of Cyric.~
@243  = ~I told you he was insane. I don't know what happened to him, but you have your proof. He's obviously still breathing.~
@244  = ~No, I'm afraid this gnome isn't the same one you're looking for. This is Tiax, not Telliax. Now, how much would you pay me to lead you to Belgin?~
@245  = ~We will have to get proof for you , I suppose... I believe I know where we can find Tiax... err, I mean "Telliax"... we will have him join us and will return.~
@246  = ~Are you questioning my word? Many have died for much lesser offences.~
@247  = ~Perhaps just information will help you. We do know Belgin's current location.~
@248  = ~You have done a noble thing this day. If he is where you say, we shall bring him to justice, though if he isn't, be sure that we'll be seeing each other again to discuss my refund. Come, friends, our quarry awaits!~
@249  = ~You will find him there. Farewell.~
@250  = ~Bounty Hunters Again

I met the bounty hunters who were tracking Belgin, but they offered us a better deal so I told them where Belgin was hiding out. I profited nicely from the deal! Hopefully they'll hang Belgin before anyone in Amn can learn the truth.~
@251  = ~Bounty Hunters Again

I met the bounty hunters who were tracking Belgin, and we tricked them into paying for a corpse. I told them where Belgin was "hiding out". I profited nicely from the deal! Hopefully they'll head back to Amn before we encounter them again, but if not, we will add their corpses to that of Belgin.~
@252  = ~Bounty Hunters Again

I met the bounty hunters who were tracking Belgin, told them where Belgin was hiding out. I profited nicely from this deal! Belgin pays, the bounty hunters pay, and hopefully they'll hang Belgin before anyone in Amn can learn the truth.~
@253  = ~Cyric!? Conquering the world!? Something must have changed him greatly indeed! Nevertheless, it's a mystery that can be solved another time. For now, our hunt has been in vain, for our target is innocent. We shall return to Amn and report on this to Telliax's father. I doubt he will be pleased. Farewell, friends. You may tell Belgin he is safe.~
@254  = ~Tiax and Karris

I proved to Karris's party that Tiax is alive and well. He's heading back to Amn, and Belgin should be safe. Belgin is waiting for us at the inn, so we had best go find him and claim our reward.~
@255  = ~Tiax and Karris

I proved to Karris's party that Tiax is alive and well. He's heading back to Amn, and Belgin's name is cleared. It is a pity that he is so soft, but he will provide more sport yet. I might be able to get a bigger reward from him. Perhaps he might not need to know that we were quite so successful... ~
@256  = ~Tiax and Karris

I proved to Karris's party that Tiax is alive and well. He's heading back to Amn, and Belgin's name is cleared. It is a pity that he is dead. I might have been able to get a bigger reward from him.~
@257  = ~Perhaps you misunderstood. We want Belgin alive. If you have proof of his death, then give it to us. If you have information on his whereabouts, we want it. If you are wasting our time, then you will answer to my sword.~
@258  = ~Oh, I love it when they talk tough!~
@259  = ~So we've become assassins, now? I do not see how this serves the balance.~
@260  = ~There now! Let's not be hasty!~
@261  = ~Ah, quit wastin' time is right. Kill 'em or leave 'em.~
@262  = ~Have a care for my specimens, <CHARNAME>!~
@263  = ~This isn't quite our finest hour.~
@264  = ~If you're looking for me, I'll be over there, doing something vitally important.~
@265  = ~<CHARNAME>, it is our duty to be truthful.~
@266  = ~This doesn't look like it's turning out so hot.~
@267  = ~Whatever serves the natural order.~
@268  = ~Whatever. We're doomed, anyway.~
@269  = ~Quit yer gabbin'. We can take the whelps.~
@270  = ~Is this distasteful display really necessary?~
@271  = ~Ye do what's right, young <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@272  = ~There are so many better uses for my inestimable talents. I think I'll go over there and make a list.~
@273  = ~Oh, this is so exciting!~
@274  = ~Luck favors the bold, <CHARNAME>!~
@275  = ~Point Minsc toward evil, <CHARNAME>, and we'll give it such a kick!~
@276  = ~Though ought not betray the innocent, <CHARNAME>.~
@277  = ~Must it always come down to fisticuffs? I just had these robes cleaned.~
@278  = ~You are eager to give Tempus his tribute? This is good!~
@279  = ~A fight is such good sport, <CHARNAME>.~
@280  = ~Decide now, <CHARNAME>. This bickering wears on my nerves.~
@281  = ~Oooh, he sounds like he means it!~
@282  = ~Ahh, well... perhaps he is not worth protecting after all. I lied. I know the whereabouts of Belgin.~
@283  = ~Well, that puts things in a different light. Belgin sought us out to help, because we know that Telliax is alive.~
@284  = ~This is getting frustrating. You know, I don't think this conversation is making headway. I will discuss this with you later.~
@285  = ~I can't dispute that. Our hunt has been in vain. We'll inform Telliax's father of these tidings. Farewell, friends; you may tell Belgin he is safe.~
@286  = ~Well that was certainly disappointing. No excitement at all.~
@287  = ~I hope this concludes our involvement with these people.~
@288  = ~Oh, I love a happy ending!~
@289  = ~Ah, I've about had it with ye pansies. Missin' a chance for a good, honest throat-slittin'!~
@290  = ~Oh, fiddlesticks! There goes my chance to study the phrenology of a bounty hunter.~
@291  = ~A glad reunion between father and son would have made a good end for this ballad, but I'll see what I can do with it anyway.~
@292  = ~Bah! Just think of all the money we could have made, playing both sides against the middle! You disappoint me, <CHARNAME>.~
@293  = ~We have done our duty. We have both asuaged a father's grief and helped clear the name of an innocent man.~
@294  = ~We showed 'em!~
@295  = ~Hmf! I'm glad that's over! Now, maybe we can get away from these mad city-dwellers.~
@296  = ~No doubt we'll find some new plot to become embroiled in, now that that matter is concluded. It's useless.~
@297  = ~Ye missed a tidy profit, sellin' out so quick.~
@298  = ~Who would have thought the mad gnome would have been that dear to anyone? Still, you can't fault a father's love.~
@299  = ~Tiax might not be a devoted son, but at least his father's mind will be put at ease.~
@300  = ~What a pity there was no reward for Tiax's head.~
@301  = ~I'm sure traipsing all over the city like this has simply ruined my pedicure.~
@302  = ~I guess it can't always be about adventure. Still, rather disappointing, don't you think?~
@303  = ~The honorable gnome's name is cleared! Boo is happy.~
@304  = ~Perchance Tiax's malodorous presence hath served some purpose, after all.~
@305  = ~Hardly a fitting use of my talents.~
@306  = ~Small men and petty schemes. There is no glory here.~
@307  = ~Cheap surfacer sentimentality! Pfgh! I've no use for it!~
@308  = ~I hope this doesn't mean you'll forgo skewering this worthless male!~
@309  = ~Farewell, Karris. May your adventures be as successful as mine have been.~
@310  = ~Well, this was fun. Not exactly what I had in mind, but we at least get to go find out what Belgin thinks this was worth. May your adventures be as successful as mine have been.~
@311  = ~Hey, Karris, stop where you are. That was way too little reward. Perhaps you would care to empty your pockets immediately? Otherwise, we will be forced to destroy you.~
@312  = ~Well, that went well. We kill the twerp, then clear his name, and walk away smelling like roses.~
@313  = ~I told Karris's party that Tiax is alive and well. He's heading back to Amn, and Belgin would be safe, if it weren't for the detail that his new job is pushing up daisies.~
@314  = ~GAAAAHHHHH!!!~
@315  = ~Ow. Tiax....Cyric! PRAISE BE TO CYRIC!~
@316  = ~No praise for that one. What now?~
@317  = ~We should lessen you by about a foot off of the top of your head. Less to feed. Less to keep an eye on.~
@318  = ~I like that "lessen". Less to feed. Less to keep an eye on. Shut up "lessen" we do it.~
@319  = ~I told you to shup up, gnome.~
@320  = ~<CHARNAME>, if you do not stop this annoyance, I will do so... permanently.~
@321  = ~Gods, will he ever just keep quiet?~
@322  = ~Tiax, are you alright? What happened?~
@323  = ~You have been warned, Tiax. This had better be worth your life.~
@324  = ~Can you keep quiet for one second, at least!? My god, you're annoying.~
@325  = ~A blessing! A blessing from the Black Sun! TIAX, chosen champion of Cyric and future ruler of all things, has been informed of the next step towards his rule of all!~
@326  = ~A blessing would be your god informing you that the next step is for you to take a long step off of the top of one of these buildings.~
@327  = ~Monty, just kill the crazy thing and be quick. No, wait - do it slowly.~
@328  = ~Oh ye blasphemers, let all who do not now bend knee to Tiax repent for Tiax is well on his way to domination of all things! We must make haste to the Helm and Cloak, for Tiax's destiny awaits him!~
@329  = ~Why the Helm and Cloak? Does this have something to do with Belgin?~
@330  = ~Oh, wonderful. Now you're hearing voices in your head as well as being a paranoid megalomaniac. Tiax, please keep your delusions to yourself.~
@331  = ~Cyric Knows ALL!~
@332  = ~*sigh* Cyric may know all, but you have not been paying attention, Tiax. We have already removed Belgin from the equation.~
@333  = ~BAH! Such impudence! If not for Tiax's good mood, he would crush you like an ant, but Tiax is far too concerned with greater matters to waste effort on you! We must go to the Helm and Cloak and butcher the heathen named Belgin! Cyric has commanded it!~
@334  = ~Why kill Belgin? We just saved him, and now you're telling me 'Cyric' wants him dead?~
@335  = ~Kill Belgin!? Are you insane? ...Oh, right.~
@336  = ~Hey, Cyric is my kind of guy. Let's go kill the little bastard!~
@337  = ~*sigh* Tiax, you have not been paying attention. That has been the plan all along. Take his money, betray him to the hunters, perhaps kill and loot the hunters after getting their money, return to Belgin, take his reward, kill him. Simple triple-cross. Let's get moving.~
@338  = ~The heathen Belgin must DIE! So Cyric has commanded, and so Tiax shall obey that his day of ascension will grow ever closer!~
@339  = ~You want us to kill Belgin!? But why would 'Cyric' want him dead after we just saved him?~
@340  = ~So, we go to all the time and trouble to save him, and now you want us to kill him? You have to be kidding me.~
@341  = ~Sounds like a plan. Let's do it.~
@342  = ~TIAX has no time for questions! Cyric has commanded it, so it shall be done and promptly! Onward, slaves! We shall bathe in blood and Tiax shall be greater for it!~
@343  = ~This is wasted time, <CHARNAME>. The rabbit is not worth the time. We have bigger prey to hunt.~
@344  = ~Silence, jaluk. In your own ridiculous description, "a pack only has one leader". If you have comments, ask your betters.~
@345  = ~GRRRRRR. Perhaps nature could do with fertilization after all. Drow blood makes fine planting soil.~
@346  = ~Tiax has no time for your naysaying and indecisiveness! Tiax has no time for slaves who think; all that need be done is to listen and OBEY! Onward to the Helm and Cloak, where Tiax's destiny awaits!~
@347  = ~There is too much talk of "slaves", male... perhaps you would prefer to become a eunuch?~
@348  = ~I am pleased to know that you will not have me as a slave! Perhaps I will not have to think of a way of disposing of you after all!~
@349  = ~The fool means t' kill any what's not his slaves.~
@350  = ~Oh, I should have though of that.~
@351  = ~Tiax is pleased with your quick obedience and mindless servitude. When he rules, perhaps he shall honor you by using you for a footstool! Off we go to slay Belgin and please Cyric!~
@352  = ~Wheee! one more step closer to your death, gnome!~
@353  = ~We have plenty of time, Monty. Be patient, and we will play with his internal organs in due course. I want to see what his brains look like...~
@354  = ~Tiax grows tired of delays. He demands we go to the Helm and Cloak and slay Belgin immediately!~
@355  = ~What is the rush, small one? We have more interesting things to attend.~
@356  = ~You talk too much, mad one.~
@357  = ~We have plenty of time. Stop bothering <CHARNAME>... and me.~
@358  = ~Aaah, the center of the universe speaks! Quiet everyone, the gods tremble at his presence *laughs* ~
@359  = ~Shut up, gnome, or I'll shut you up.~
@360  = ~So, the gods move us to this end, eh? I see little to be gained by rushing things. We might go finish this, or we might not.~
@361  = ~OK, Tiax, we will get to your business soon. Belgin isn't going anywhere, but we might as well wrap this up.~
@362  = ~Tiax, we will get to your business as soon as I choose. There is more profit in following our present course. Belgin isn't going anywhere, and neither are those bounty hunters.~
@363  = ~BAH! Tiax's slaves delay and delay, and now Tiax will stand for no more! Away with ye, and beware the day when Tiax's shadow consumes this world, for Tiax's wrath shall be great indeed!~
@364  = ~Goodbye, and good riddance!~
@365  = ~Less to feed. Less to keep an eye on. Less talk, "lessen" I lessen you by about a foot off the top.~
@366  = ~Fewer in the party means more profit for them as remain.~
@367  = ~Finally. (I was about to kill him myself, but I can always scry his movements later.)~
@368  = ~I did not trust him. You may want to follow him and kill him quickly, or hire another to so so.~
@369  = ~Let the gnome go to the hells his god promises.~
@370  = ~I'm sorry you feel that way, Tiax. Good luck.~
@371  = ~Tiax Leaves

The madness finally overtook Tiax, and he left the party in disgust. It will certainly be easier travelling without the mad one, but perhaps less interesting.~
@372  = ~Goodbye and good riddance, crazy gnome.~
@373  = ~Wait, Tiax, are you sure you can't wait a little longer?~
@374  = ~Goodbye.~
@375  = ~We haven't talked to Karris, yet.~
@376  = ~We have talked, but we haven't come to an agreement.~
@377  = ~Please, hurry! I cannot stand living like this for much longer.~
@378  = ~I have decided it is time for you to die, gnome.~
@379  = ~You - damn you! Damn your black soul for all eternity! I am leaving!~
@380  = ~BAH! Tiax will stand for no more! Away with ye, and beware the day when Tiax's shadow consumes this world, for Tiax's wrath shall be great indeed!~
@381  = ~Tiax Leaves

Tiax was very unhappy with us letting Belgin go, and he left the party in disgust. It will certainly be easier travelling without the mad one, but perhaps less interesting.~
@382  = ~Belgin is dead, Tiax. Dead. Already.~
@383  = ~How DARE you defy the will of Cyric?!~
