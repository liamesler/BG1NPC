@0    = ~Oh, I am going to get *so* dirty. And these shoes are brand new... *sigh*~
@1    = ~So this is your home? How... quaint.~
@2    = ~Hey! What are you doing? That was only one smelly old ogre, I bet you could have beaten him with one arm behind your back! Hmph. Some adventurer you are...~
@3    = ~There is more to adventuring than cracking heads, Skie. You would do well to remember that.~
@4    = ~Oh, pardon me, Skie... Hey! Hey Larze! Come back here! There's a kid here who seems to think that she can take you down with one arm behind her back!~
@5    = ~Why don't you just get back in line and keep your mouth firmly shut, eh, Skie?~
@6    = ~*Ignore Skie*~
@7    = ~Well, If you say so... I still think we could have taken him, though...~
@8    = ~Hey! Wha... what are you doing?! I said *you* could have taken him, not me! Are you trying to get me killed?~
@9    = ~Oh... er... I'm sorry... I'll just er... keep quiet then...~
@10   = ~Wha... what do you mean you won't harm him? You... you must! He killed my father, and... and yours, too! He deserves to die, he *must* die!~
@11   = ~Great! A chance for me to show you what I can do!~
@12   = ~Yes, yes, indeed, lady. Will you take the job?~
@13   = ~*Psst*... <CHARNAME>, I recognize this man. He came to father's house sometimes... I don't trust him.~
@14   = ~Is 'wisdom' gained in your father's house a perfect guide to trust, my dear? What of myself?~
@15   = ~Bu... but Eldoth, I was only trying to help... sorry... ~
@16   = ~You... you monster! If father were here to stop you, you would be... be hanging from the gallows!~
@17   = ~Ahhh, but sadly he isn't. A tragic, tragic loss to us all. But what is even more tragic is, that in her distraught state of mind his beautiful young daughter decided to take revenge on the men that she thought killed her father... Such a waste. *sigh* No matter...~
@18   = ~How dare you! My father-~
@19   = ~Your father would do nothing, Lady Silvershield. Unless you raise him from his grave.~
@20   = ~What?!? Wha... what are you saying?~
@21   = ~I'm afraid your father, most regrettably, was diced over an extended period of time, by a person or persons unknown.~
@22   = ~Father?.. Wait, you... you're *lying* - father's bodyguards were among the finest in the city's guard... they would never let mere thugs get within a breadth of him.~
@23   = ~Ah... well, due to the present state of emergency, those had to be reassigned to more important duties.~
@24   = ~What?! More IMPORTANT!?! What's more important to the city than the life of a Grand Duke? ~
@25   = ~There are the lives - and property - of all citizens to be secured by maintenance of public order. And, oh yes. There is the invasion from Amn to defend against. Or perhaps in your Grand Tour with your fellow thugs, you'd not heard of that?~
@26   = ~The threat from Amn is YOUR invention! Liar!~
@27   = ~Eldoth, I... I do not know what to believe... Angelo is a liar, that much is true... but something feels wrong... Can we make time to visit the estate? I must know what has happened to my father.~
@28   = ~<CHARNAME>, I... I do not know what to believe... Angelo is a liar, that much is true... but something feels wrong... Can we make time to visit the estate? I must know what has happened to my father.~
@29   = ~Guards! Silence that noisy wench. I have wasted too much time already on the case of these wretched assassins.~
@30   = ~Ugh... I didn't realise that adventuring would include... *this*.~
@31   = ~Wow... a nymph? I've read about them in my father's library. Can we go see the nymph, Eldoth? Can we?~
@32   = ~If you wish to gaze upon beauty, a mirror would serve you better than nymphs, my...~
@33   = ~Thhpppt! I know what *I* look like. I want to see a nymph. Now!~
@34   = ~*sighs* Then if, against all reason, <CHARNAME> approves... ~
@35   = ~Hey, wait! Don't you know who I am? I am Skie Silvershield, daughter of Entar Silvershield, and I demand that you let us go!~
@36   = ~Silvershield, eh? If you were really his daughter, would you be filthy with dirt, dressed like a tramp and coercing with these murderers? I think not, kid.~
@37   = ~Poi... poison? Oh... er... I don't feel well... I think... I think I need to lie down.~
@38   = ~If you want to live, girl, you do what I ask of you.~
@39   = ~<CHARNAME> I recognize him now... this... this gnome... he was arrested for... for murdering a mass of innocent children some months ago... thirty-three *innocent* children... ~
@40   = ~*innocent*? Brats, they were all brats.~
@41   = ~Tha... that's horrible... poor Scar. He always seemed like a good, honorable man... and now... now he's dead...~
@42   = ~This is terrible... we've got to do something, <CHARNAME>... We couldn't save my father... but we've got to try and save Eltan... I owe it... to my father...~
@43   = ~Wh-what?~
@44   = ~I said: YOU WILL WAIT HERE, UNTIL LARZE GETS BACK!~
@45   = ~Oh.. you poor soul. Here, take this coin and get something to eat.~
@46   = ~*sigh* Another soul gone south! Oh, well. I suppose, at need, we can nick it back from the bartender, who will receive it anon.~
@47   = ~But... but... I'm... *so* hungry... ~
@48   = ~Really?!? Then your hard-begged coin is safe from me, for I refuse to clip a rats'-meat vendor.~
@49   = ~You're a saint, milady.~
@50   = ~And thy ladyship... pssst... ditch that pigeon... ~
@51   = ~By the authority of the estate of Entar Silvershield, I demand that you let us in! Grand Duke's Belt and Liia are in terrible danger, we must warn them!~
@52   = ~Hey, kid, you took a smack to the head? Entar Silvershield is dead! That name carries no weight anymore, so take your stupid conspiracy theories and get lost!~
@53   = ~Oh, I'm sure he's just exaggerating.~
@54   = ~Scar's dead? Wow... I... er... I... mean, my father always spoke very highly of him... And Eltan, too. Oh no! Wha... what about my father? Come on, we have to make sure he's alright!~
@55   = ~Ahhh...*if* your father is in danger, we should serve him better by retaining our freedom of action than by rushing headlong into an ambush. Not to mention what *he* would do about that freedom, if unambushed.~
@56   = ~But...~
@57   = ~No buts, my dear. You are distraught and so should trust in cooler heads. ~
@58   = ~Oh... er... I suppose so...~
@59   = ~I am sorry, girl... but your father is- er... you go, see Eltan.~
@60   = ~If... if you are not going to kill Sarevok, then you must at least kill these... these assassins... Someone must pay for my fathers death... someone...~
@61   = ~Gods! That must be the *new* Lady Silvershield Skie complained so much about. Better-looking, as great a fool, and yet more susceptible, if I am any judge, than the one I have taken such pains over. *sigh* I suppose it is too late to switch at this point...~
@62   = ~Pssst... <CHARNAME>, this is my father's new "wife". Let's get out of here!~
@63   = ~Hmph, she always was a gutter tramp. *sigh* If only father would've listened...~
@64   = ~A coin for your effort, my good <PRO_MANWOMAN>...~
@65   = ~Brilla, *wait*! It's me...~
@66   = ~Wha... Skie? What are you doing?~
@67   = ~I.. I'm just er... popping out. Heh...~
@68   = ~Hmph, dressed like a sewer rat, and with your pack on your shoulders? Hardly, dear - you're running away, aren't you? ~
@69   = ~BI... yes. I'm leaving. Er... will you tell my father?~
@70   = ~Hmmm... tell him? Why, of course not! This is indeed a delightful turn of events...~
@71   = ~Wha..?~
@72   = ~My dear, you are but a pampered little rich girl. You whine when you break a *nail*. Do you really think you'll be able to survive in the big bad world? A finer example of goblin bait I've never seen.~
@73   = ~And when you do eventually fall by the road side, *I* will be the one sitting on top of the Silvershield fortune.~
@74   = ~Now you run along - though... maybe, you could leave your friend, hmm... ? *smiles at Eldoth*~
@75   = ~You... You BITCH!~
@76   = ~Stay away from my Eldoth!~
@77   = ~Now, now, my dearest. We can hardly hope to keep your... um... departure a secret, can we? Even from someone so self-absorbed as your father? Let us, then, mount upon the wings of Love and fly where they will take us. *Hugs Skie and winks at Brilla over her shoulder.*~
@78   = ~TeeHee! If I ever need a humorist to brighten a dull evening, I know now where to apply. Take good care, sweetie! *Skie snarls and drags Eldoth from the room.*~
@79   = ~You... you are the ones that killed my father? I'll make you pay for what you've done! I... I'll kill you...~
@80   = ~*chuckle* Oh, baby, look! Daddy's girl has come to pay us a visit!~
@81   = ~Ahh, how sweet... Hmmm... Shall we tell her, Sythie?~
@82   = ~Shall we tell her how daddy squealed like a piglet, when I sunk my blade into his gullet? Or how about when he bawled like a little girl, when you told him that you would hunt down his precious little daughter and bleed her to death?~
@83   = ~Honey...~
@84   = ~Or maybe tell her, how the big brave Duke made this *tiny* little gurgling noise, when I drew my blade across his throat? Or how... ~
@85   = ~Slythe, honey... enough talk, let's just *show* her. I'm famished... ~
@86   = ~Skie? Is... is that you? Yes... yes, it is... I have found you at last...~
@87   = ~Dora? What are you doing here? Did father send you to find me?~
@88   = ~No... Skie, there is something you must know...~
@89   = ~Because if he did, you can tell him that I am not going back to that cage, I've had it with his lectures, I've had enough of hi... ~
@90   = ~Your father is dead, Skie.~
@91   = ~Wha... dea... dead?~
@92   = ~Bu... but how? I mean... dead... I don... I don't understand... how is this...~
@93   = ~My poor child... He was... was murdered... the authorities seem to think it was a Shadow Thief Assassin...~
@94   = ~The... Shadow Thieves? But tha... that doesn't make sense... I mean, why... *sniff*... why him?~
@95   = ~I do not know the answer to that, child, but you must listen to me... there... there is something else... Walter was the one who discovered your father... nigh on a tenday ago... A few days later, when the news was broken to the rest of the city, it was announced that a cloak and dagger were found on your father, implicating a Shadow Thieves assassination...~
@96   = ~But Walter *saw* your father... And he was more than certain that there was no cloak nor dagger in the room...~
@97   = ~*sob* Whe... where is Walter now?~
@98   = ~Alas, he has disappeared. None of the other servants had seen him for the last three days... I fear the worst... And that my dear, is why I must leave...~
@99   = ~Leave?... No... please, Dora, you... you can't leave... *sniff* You are all the family I have... *sniff* Don't leave me...~
@100  = ~I... I'm sorry, child... I must... I fear that the evil that took your father from you may soon come to claim me. I must leave... while I still can... I am so sorry, Skie... ~
@101  = ~Here, child, I want you to have this necklace... It was given to me, by my mother, many years ago... I... I had always dreamt that someday I could pass it on to *my* own daughter... Somebody that I loved more... than... ~
@102  = ~I... I... I don't know what to say...~
@103  = ~Then say nothing. I do not need to hear any words, my child... I... must go now... Take care, Skie... May your path always be blessed... Farewell... ~
@104  = ~Dora? Wait... where is father? Angelo said tha... that he was dead... is it true?~
@105  = ~*sigh* I'm afraid that the serpent has spouted no lie, child. Your father is gone.~
@106  = ~Bu... but how? I mean... dead... I don't understand... how is this...~
@107  = ~My poor child... He... was murdered. The 'authorities' seem to think it was a Shadow Thief Assassin.~
@108  = ~The... Shadow Thieves? But tha... that doesn't make sense... I mean why... *sniff*... why him?~
@109  = ~I do not know the answer to that child, but you *must* listen to me. There... there is something else. Walter was the one who discovered your father... nigh on a tenday ago. A few days later, when the news was broken to the rest of the city, it was announced that a cloak and dagger were found on your father, implicating a Shadow Thieves assassination.~
@110  = ~Here child, I want you to have this necklace... It was given to me, by my mother many years ago... I... I had always dreamt that someday I could pass it on to *my* own daughter... Somebody that I loved more... than... ~
@111  = ~So it is true... We... we should go. I don't think that I could face the house now... not while father's murderers still walk the streets. Can.. can we get going? I... I need some time to think about this.~
@112  = ~Ehhh... halt! Who goes... Why, Miz Skie! You ain't supposed to be out here! Your daddy said not!~
@113  = ~Clearly, I *am* out here though and must depart. I have matters of great urgency to attend to. ~
@114  = ~B-but... Miz Skie... your daddy didn't say nothin' 'bout no 'urgent matters', just that you wasn't to be gallavantin' no more.~
@115  = ~Did my father give orders about what you should do in the event I did 'go gallavanting' once more?~
@116  = ~Ehhh... not so clearly, no... guess I could go tell someone... or something.~
@117  = ~I'm glad we didn't have to hurt him. Jessup's a very old family retainer.~
@118  = ~Manifestly. But in case we should meet someone as... um... alert but more stalwart, it would forestall mere vulgar brawling, my dear, if you concealed your lovely features beneath this cloak whilst in town. I picked it out for you myself, as the color goes very well with your eyes.~
@119  = ~Oooh! Thank you! It's very pretty but... isn't it rather warm for this time of year?~
@120  = ~A... trifle, perhaps. But warmish *outside* your cage which is the crucial point.~
@121  = ~You're right. I can only hope...that my eyeshadow doesn't run.~
@122  = ~The child becomes the father, or so it desperately wishes. The blood pulls, calls, and demands. The wise Alaundo did say unto the ages, that the Lord of Murder would perish and his doom would spawn his mortal progeny. Chaos would be sown in their passage, but to what purpose? Have you felt the hunger and heard the offerings of power? Sarevok thinks they are true, and so he seeks a senseless war, and a slaughter of a scale so grand as to defy description. He thinks it will launch him to... to what? Possibly he is right, but I cannot lose him to this.~
@123  = ~He must die! There is no other way!~
@124  = ~Why do you oppose him, when you so clearly care for his life?~
@125  = ~I shall strive to stop him, and will do what I can to see that he lives.~
@1001  = ~That is immaterial. She has an invitation.~
