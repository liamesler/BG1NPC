@0    = ~What is that armour I see you possess? The quality of the stitching and interweaving of leather and mail is unsurpassed... Where could you have got such a well-crafted suit? Never mind, each man must have his secrets, and I am an abjurer, not a diviner, by trade.~
@1    = ~I am, of course, talking about that pleasantly colored suit of chainmail you own. By the looks of it, it would be a bard's garb? I can imagine it must allow freedom of movement enough so as to not restrict spellcasting. Very useful...~
@2    = ~Thanks for the compliment.~
@3    = ~I've come to buy something, actually...~
@4    = ~I'd better be going.~
@5    = ~Hello again. Have you changed your mind on my offer? I do believe that the armour would be most beneficial.~
@6    = ~Yes, I have. Please, improve my armour.~
@7    = ~Not at this time, thank you. May I see your wares?~
@8    = ~Not today. Farewell.~
@9    = ~Now, the pair of us may be able to help each other out. In exchange for letting me look at the suit, that I may perhaps come to understand the manner of construction and nature of enchantments on it, I will further strengthen its protective abilities. For a modest fee, of course...~
@10   = ~That sounds great!~
@11   = ~What's the catch?~
@12   = ~I'd really rather just buy something, actually.~
@13   = ~Sorry, but I have to be going.~
@14   = ~All I require is 1,000 gold... And a pair of Golden Pantaloons. If you bring them to me, it should only take a matter of minutes.~
@15   = ~I'll bear that in mind. In the meantime, can I see your wares?~
@16   = ~I'll be back later, then.~
@17   = ~All I require is 1,000 gold... And that pair of Golden Pantaloons I see. If you are willing, it should only take a matter of minutes.~
@18   = ~I'll think about it. Farewell.~
@19   = ~Excellent! Then I shall begin...~
@20   = ~Almost done...~
@21   = ~There. Protection, style, service with a smile. It was good doing business with you, my <LADYLORD>.~
