@0    = ~Get out of my way, rascal! Bog off!~
@1    = ~Books, books, books. Out of the way, you young rascals! In my day the youth were much more respectful of their elders... And much better versed in great literature too. Oh yes. Bah.~
@2    = ~Yeah? Well Yah, Boo to you, too, old man!~
@3    = ~Um, sorry, sir.~
@4    = ~It seems Faerun is full of crazy old men these days. Let's move along. Quickly.~
@5    = ~Ha! Like I said, disrespectful. Perhaps you could've learnt something from my countless years of wisdom, not to mention my books. But I guess you were just too brash to take the hint.~
@6    = ~Manners, eh! So perhaps modern living hasn't completely eroded the last vestiges of decency from you. Perhaps I can help you...~
@7    = ~Help me? How?~
@8    = ~I doubt an old man has much to offer me. Maybe I'll be off now.~
@9    = ~Well, I'm a librarian. Or, well, I used to be, though now I'm selling off my collection to finance my long-overdue retirement.~
@10   = ~Oh really? Doing anything nice?~
@11   = ~*sit and listen*~
@12   = ~Yadda yadda yadda... Get on with it.~
@13   = ~I'm glad you asked me that actually, I'm thinking of going further south in Amn, perhaps to the Umar Hills or somewhere...~
@14   = ~I don't believe all this talk of impending war. As far as I'm concerned, it's a nice quiet place, where nothing happens. Nothing unexpected, no adventurers or anything. Zilch. I'll have a nice, quiet life. And best of all, no more books!~
@15   = ~Now you may disagree, but I have quite a good sense of judgement about these things. Anyway, that's beside the point. You're distracting me.~
@16   = ~Yeah, sorry. You were saying?~
@17   = ~Yes, I'm selling my collection, though actually I've made enough money to live on now. I have but a few books left. Perhaps you'd be interested in this one - The Ultimate Compendium Of Famous Little-Known Heroes, by an old friend of mine, one Saemon Schama.~
@18   = ~Wow, could it really be The Ultimate Compendium Of Famous Little-Known Heroes, by Saemon Schama? Please, <CHARNAME>, this is a great book! I'd really love to have it!~
@19   = ~Ah, you would be a scholar then, my boy?~
@20   = ~A bard, sir... I've always wanted a copy of that, since I was knee-high to a gnome. It is one of the classics - the author is a genius!~
@21   = ~Though he's not quite up to my level, he is a fairly intelligent character, <CHARNAME>. I mean, for a human, of course, anything he's written is probably worth at least a quick peek.~
@22   = ~Well then, if it pleases you, I'll give it to you for free. It's rare to meet such well-mannered types as yourselves. Good business to you, now, if you'll excuse me, I have my retirement to be getting on with. And one last bit of advice: things read in books can often prove very useful. Oh yes.~
@23   = ~Oh, a senile librarian gives an important tome to an eager young adventuring bard? Please, what is this? What did I do to deserve such idiots for companions?~
@24   = ~You're a good man, sir. I won't forget this.~
@25   = ~Hey, <CHARNAME>! There's a passage in this book about the long-dead half-elven bard Myr'Cutio, who is said to roam undead in the valleys around a place called Ulcaster looking for further tales of adventure. Hey, there's rough directions, it's sort of close, east of Beregost! Perhaps we could go check it out?~
@26   = ~I see no harm in that. Who knows, if true we may learn something.~
@27   = ~I thought that crazy old librarian was bad enough, Garrick, but if you don't shut up, then I'll shove that book where the sun don't shine, if you catch my drift...~
@28   = ~Wow! Thanks, <CHARNAME>.~
@29   = ~Traveling Librarians.

Today we met a doddering old librarian named Archibald at the Nashkel Carnival. He gave us a copy of The Ultimate Compendium Of Famous Little-Known Heroes by Saemon Schama, which has an interesting section detailing the now-undead bard Myr'Cutio, who is said to haunt the Ulcaster region roughly to the east of Beregost. Garrick is keen to take a look.~
@30   = ~Fine, but I bet we'll regret if we don't go...~
