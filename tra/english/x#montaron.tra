@2    = ~I must admit that you surprise me. Cooking isn't a talent I'd have associated with someone of your temperament.~

@12   = ~As they's only the one cookin' pot and it's all-share-all, I'd suffer it, too, which me stummick'd mislike. 'Sides, if I had somethin' like that in mind, ye'd know of it long 'fore dinner time.~

@66   = ~Minsc barges in 'n gets kilt, <CHARNAME>, the heroic idjit, hies up to die beside o' him, an' the only question left to the rest o' us is, can we run faster than them as kilt 'em?~
@67   = ~Art thou suggesting that I impugn the honor and warp the duty of that noble warrior spirit?~
@68   = ~Aye. Honor 'n duty are serviceable enow, but at the point they stop servicin', warp 'em t' yer need 'n call foul fair t' do so, an ye gotta.~

@78   = ~I'll give ye this much, Thayvian: ye sets up a brave show in yer robes o' office.~
@79   = ~Of course. 'Tis symbolic of our disregard of inferiors to disdain disguise.~
@80   = ~And I'm for that. Ye makes a splendid target so.~
@81   = ~Eh? If you think...~

@89   = ~Nah, ain't none o' that. These other fellers I mentioned, they had they fine plans, too, only the plans never quite worked as was spoken of.~
@90   = ~And these fine-speakin' fellers, they had *no* taste at all fer makin' amends on the spot, when somethin' gone definitely amiss.~
@91   = ~In truth, that sounds a sensible evaluation to me. One's hide *is* worth more than all the gold in Faerun – to oneself at any rate.~
@92   = ~So *they* thought, I s'pose. They took th' gold 'n th' hides and hid 'em both. But they was wrong in the end, 'cause they kept not gold nor hides neither, once I found where they was sequestered at.~
@93   = ~Then I shall avoid their error and strive mightily at your side. The probability of such need arising, however, is very small. It simply is not *that* sort of job.~
@94   = ~Uh-huh. They said that, too – aforehand.~
@95   = ~Pfeh! Ye can leave off makin' yer racket now. Done skairt all edibles fer a league already.~
@96   = ~Nature's bounty is not restricted to what goes on foot or wing. That is the lesson I would impart.~
@97   = ~Tell me stummick that, or Xzar's or <CHARNAME>'s, when they's no bit o' meat t' dinner.~

@99   = ~The most spirit anythin' in nature shows involves eatin' without bein' et.~

@101  = ~Well, ye *do* seem happier'n a clam inna clam bar.~
@102  = ~And why not? I'm traveling again, after all. The cause is worthy, and 'tis good to have written "finis" to my term with Silke, I must admit.~
@103  = ~Mmm-hmmm. I wondered a bit at that. Ye seemed a willin' enow footman t' her, yet lifted no finger when she needed ye to.~
@104  = ~She was vile, cruel, capricious, utterly self-centered and unspeakably evil. And yet somehow very good at offering inducements that overrode one's common sense and judgment.~
@105  = ~Hope ye don't quit inna middle of no fight, while ye ponders yer first impressions o' us.~
@106  = ~What? But you... you and <CHARNAME> have nothing in common with her. Surely not?~
@107  = ~Hey, hold me large knife half a tick, would ye?~
@108  = ~Montaron... what are you doing to those poor things?~
@109  = ~Eh, you wants squirrel stew fer supper, ye gotta bleed 'em nice, thicken the broth.~
@110  = ~But they're still alive!~
@111  = ~*Course* they still be alive. They stops bleedin' if they dies, don't they?~
@112  = ~Ewww! I couldn't eat a bite of that!~
@113  = ~More fer the rest o' us, then, lovey-face.~
@114  = ~Hey! Whazzat? Oh... damn rodent!~
@115  = ~Badgers are not rodents.~
@116  = ~Yeah. They's squatty 'n lives in holes. They oughta be rodents... *that* un should, anyways.~
@117  = ~If Nature allowed individual exceptions on your criteria...~
@118  = ~...I'd be a rat or skunk or somesuch, I know. Might as well be married t' ye meself, th' way ye insults me without need.~
@119  = ~When one confronts Zhents, the need is for blades. Merely to insult is a sign of great restraint.~
@120  = ~If'n we gets clear o' this iron to-do, I'll 'member yer "restraint", no fear.~
@121  = ~Eh, dwarf... don't ye never find yer style o' fighting a bit dull?~
@122  = ~Only if I find no gold at the other end. What you getting' at?~
@123  = ~Just *once* I'm thinkin' ye might try somethin' asides from waddlin' straight to their nearest guy and dealin' lumps 'n takin' 'em.~
@124  = ~The lumps I deal hurt more and last longer. And it gives 'em a brave show whilst you sneaks behind, deciding where 'tis safest to carve a new bunghole at.~
@125  = ~Ain't sayin' it don't suit me. Ye just oughta have more'n one card in yer hand. 's called stragedy.~
@126  = ~P'raps I'll slip up under cover of your snoring and "stragedize" your skull one evening.~

@128  = ~Hey, tongue-tripper, you ever charged a foe like a man? Or don't the wifey approve such goings-on?~
@129  = ~It s-simplifies your t-task in that you know where the rear of the enemy formation will be. This, I've noted, is the side of an enemy you p-prefer to address in any case.~
@130  = ~Whichever works best. I can do face-to-face, too, as ye'll find out some fine day.~
@131  = ~I await your p-pleasure. But for this t-time, we must concentrate jointly upon the iron s-shortage. May I assume you had some notion in addressing me beyond an exchange of p-pointless insults?~
@132  = ~Aye, I was curious if ye had a single notion of tactics under that chamber pot as serves ye as a topper. I see naught, though.~
@133  = ~If you prefer to charge b-blindly forward, rather than assessing your foes as they come to you, I'll have no fear of *your* t-tactics when the good day comes.~
@134  = ~Heh, heh, that lass o' yours... if'n we could turn that tongue against our enemies to such effect, we'd be set fer certain.~
@135  = ~And I have r-regretted that we cannot afflict them with the m-mental occlusions of your mage.~
@136  = ~Hey, I'm not married t' the fur-brained maggot, am I?~
@137  = ~No. Nor have you the charity which may ignore s-superficial frictions for the sake of pleasure in the essence of another.~
@138  = ~Pfeh! Charity's what beggars live on.~
@139  = ~Then we are all b-beggars, for our existence depends upon the charity of the gods.~
@140  = ~Cripes, another looney!~
@141  = ~Hoi, ye knows yer woods, don't ye?~
@142  = ~I know of woodlands, but I am no more familiar with this particular locale than yourself.~
@143  = ~Damnation! Don't suppose ye've got a recipe fer forest quickbeer neither, huh?~
@144  = ~No. Indeed, I have never heard of such a libation.~
@145  = ~Me either. Was just hopin' *ye* might've, me bein' that dry.~
@146  = ~I have observed enough of our surroundings to have noted a fresh, clear brook nearby. I can guide you to it.~
@147  = ~Pfeh! Said I was "dry", not "thirsty".~
@148  = ~Then I recommend you to console yourself with the thought of how good your beer will taste upon our return to more a populous region.~
@149  = ~Aye. *If* we returns.~
@150  = ~Arrrgh! Watch yer clomper, big 'un.~
@151  = ~I regret my foot. I was looking afar and did not see you there. Boo did, but he had no time to give me warning.~
@152  = ~Well, tell yer hamster to get quicker in his uptake or next dinner-time, it's in t' the pot wi' him.~
@153  = ~Ha, ha... what? Boo says to tell you not to repeat such things. He does not believe that you were joking.~
@154  = ~I *weren't* jokin'. Figgered the fault was wi' yer feet, but yer hamster would taste better.~
@155  = ~Without doubt. So often has Minsc trod upon Evil, that his feet are quite stinky and wholly unappetizing.~
@156  = ~Ghaaah! Yer all safe from me. Got no appetite left fer nothin'.~
@157  = ~So ye claim t' be smart wi' yer head...~

@162  = ~What! You compare mere physical dexterity with the vistas open to unparalleled intellect and faith such as I possess? Why, even in the base sphere of practicality...~
@163  = ~Here. Have yer sling back.~
@164  = ~My sling? What do you mean? It isn't miss- oh, I see. I, uh, knew you took that.~
@165  = ~May want these here stones fer it, too.~
@166  = ~Well, I was going to let you carry them for me for a little while, but I guess I'll have them back.~
@167  = ~So, it occurs t' me, ye and I, betwixt us, would be pretty well set fer anythin' as come along.~
@168  = ~I see. And what would your employers say to this, well, possible partnership?~
@169  = ~Employment's a thick word. But stretched mighty thin out here.~
@170  = ~Hmmm. It is clear to one as wise as myself that we could do far worse than exercising caution on one another's behalf.~
@171  = ~Lookee, twister. I don't mind ye duckin' fer cover at the first hint o' trouble. Ye be less apt to get inna way, so.~
@172  = ~I do not regard your...~

@174  = ~I am *not* accustomed...~
@175  = ~...and I don't mind ye takin' first pass at the loot, neither. Ye'll do well enough as pack mule 'til we gets somewheres to cash in.~
@176  = ~You *dare* to...~
@177  = ~...but I grow THAT sick o' ye jabberin' at *me* between times, that I am gonna forget all them benefits about ye 'n shut ye up permanent, if they's ONE more word in me direction. Got it?!~
@178  = ~<CHARNAME>, if you must allow this creature off its leash, will you *please* muzzle it? To let it slobber freely about is so... unsanitary.~
@179  = ~Hey, watch where ye're agoin'!~
@180  = ~Stand clear of my path, male. I take large steps.~
@181  = ~That "male" talk got ye stuck t' us already. Should a thought ye'd learned that lesson by now.~
@182  = ~I have learned only that my original assessment was too kindly. You, for instance, I once would have ignored, but you offend more, even, than others for your redoubling your arrogant male swagger to compensate for your half-size.~
@183  = ~Gotta keep in step wi' me pals, don't I?~
@184  = ~What is that supposed to mean?~
@185  = ~Ye've said it yerself. I'm half-sized, so I gots to swagger twice as hard, or I gets kicked four times as much. Then I gotta kill the kicker 'n that ain't sensible fer a steady program.~
@186  = ~You really expect me to believe that your repulsive assumption of aggressive superiority is a product of *thought*?~
@187  = ~Nine Hells, woman! I'm a thief fer choice. Sneak's me middle name, and that means NOT bein' noticed. But I needs an array t' see me through me off-duty hours as well, don't I?~
@188  = ~Hmm. You seem to have achieved a minim of self-awareness... I am not sure... I think that your cynical exploitation of masculine traits makes you more repellant still.~
@189  = ~Crimony! Another dip.~
@190  = ~I wouldn't have thought the company of thieves would disturb *you*.~
@191  = ~If they can't do nothin' else, and th' job's as rough-n-tumble as this here, then it do.~

@194  = ~You know nothing of love! Of two hearts, two souls attuned in perfect harmony...~
@195  = ~Right, right, right. All the same, I'd double-latch me purse 'n then sit on it, were I in yer knickers.~
@196  = ~I knows I'm gonna kick meself fer askin', but if all *don't* serve ye, what then?~
@197  = ~There will be no choice. By his will alone, Tiax will decree the servitude. None may will but to obey.~

@207  = ~Agreed. Which is why I wished ye wouldn't rattle on so 'bout 'em.~
@208  = ~May you be stranded, alone, in the Underdark. I would hear you maintain yourself there, using fewer words than I have here.~
@209  = ~Easy. "Which way's outa here" 'ud be all'n I'd need.~
@210  = ~And you would be shown, rather than told, of your exit. It is the grave.~
@211  = ~Mayhap. Wouldn't be the only one usin' it, though.~
@212  = ~It's just another step to the inevitable in this doomed mission of mine. *sighs* Mulahey's certainly not the source of the iron shortage. I doubt I'll be able to live to see who is behind it all, let alone see tomorrow.~
@213  = ~Back to yer cave wit' ye, then. Ye'll make a fine haunt here in a twelvemonth, I'm thinkin'. Mebbe sooner.~
@214  = ~Is that supposed to be a threat? Hmm, no matter. 'Tis weak at best. At the very least, I should want to feel the sun on my face before something *does* go wrong.~
@215  = ~Well, if ye ain't gonna crawl back to yer wormhole just yet, how about ye keeps yer glimmers peeled fer more o' them yippers, whilst I commence lootin' bodies?~
