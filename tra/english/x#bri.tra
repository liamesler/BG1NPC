@0    = ~I'm sorry, Briel, but we... we have been over this already... and you have said, that...~
@1    = ~That you are an idiot. Go, if you want, but maybe someday you'll figure out what is it you really want, elf.~
@2    = ~I must thank you again for the service you have done.~
@3    = ~<CHARNAME>, it's becoming too dangerous to keep Namara around. Not to mention all the bad habits she picks up from our rag-tag band... I'll go talk to Briel.~ [CORAN99]
@4    = ~I hope that I still have some influence over her... *grins* so it should not take me long to presuade her to take money and visits instead of me babysitting Namara on battlefields. Meet me back in the "Sturgeon", <CHARNAME>.~
@5    = ~Ah, here you are. Back to adventure! ~
@6    = ~May I have a word with you, <CHARNAME>?~ [CORAN99]
@7    = ~Of course, Coran, what is it?~
@8    = ~Yes, but not now.~
@9    = ~Coran... frankly, I have no desire to talk to you, after what you have done...~
@10   = ~I... I would like very much to go back and talk to Briel again. The girl might need help, and I feel that I have wronged her... Can we go meet with her?~
@11   = ~Coran, I am glad that you have decided to sort it out. All this made me feel awkward. We should go visit Briel as soon as we are able.~
@12   = ~Coran, are you kidding? The girl is blackmailing you! I mean, you never wanted a child, did you? Why do you need to waste your time? She wanted it, so she can take care of the whelp herself!~
@13   = ~Well, I am afraid that in this case we should part our company. ~
@14   = ~I understand that, <CHARNAME>. I am unhappy with what I have said to Briel myself. The girl might need help, and I feel that I have wronged her... I... I would like very much to go back and talk to Briel again. Can we go meet with her?~
@15   = ~Well, I am afraid that in this case we should part our company.~
@16   = ~We will talk later then.~
@17   = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I feel much better now.~
@18   = ~Indeed... I have never wanted a child, and a half-breed, at that. Half-bloods are always raised by their mothers. Besides, I just don't have the time or inclination to care for my... I mean, Briel's child.~
@19   = ~*sighs* You are right. See you in 20 years or so...~
@20   = ~I'd like to talk about Briel, <CHARNAME>.~ [CORAN99]
@21   = ~Well, I am afraid that in this case we should part our company. See you in 20 years or so...~
@22   = ~Ahem, <CHARNAME>, I know we are rather busy, but I really need to talk to Briel... Can we go see her now?~ [CORAN99]
@23   = ~We should go visit Briel as soon as we are able.~
@24   = ~Coran, I like this idea less and less. The girl is just blackmailing you! I mean you never wanted a child, did you? Why do you need to waste your time? She wanted it, so she can take care of the whelp herself.~
@25   = ~Briel is not going to wait forever! It is apparent that you have things more important to attend to than the fate of my daughter. I do not. See you in 20 years or so...~ [CORAN99]
@26   = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I am no coward, but when a baby's life is at stake... I will run for it.~
@27   = ~Erm... <CHARNAME>. It cannot be that bad, can it?~
@28   = ~I... I am glad that you see it that way. It is a bastard child, after all.~
@29   = ~I... I... Briel... I do not know.~
@30   = ~*sighs* I am sorry, beautiful, but there is really nothing I can do for you or your child.~
@31   = ~Coran?~
@32   = ~Thank you, again, <CHARNAME>.~
@33   = ~Brielbara, I promise you, that if it gets hot, Coran will run and save the child.~
@34   = ~You are a mad woman, Brielbara, but we'll try to keep Namara safe and well.~
@35   = ~Great, just great. That's *just* what we need.~
@36   = ~You have done well, my love.~
@37   = ~That would not do at all. Brielbara, Coran is my sworn sword, and as his liege <PRO_LADYLORD>, I accept the responsibility for his past misdeeds. As he has no inclination to marry you, and I do not wish to force him in this matter, I would like to pay you 10,000 gold as a compensation for his dishonoring you. I trust that it is enough for you to live comfortably until you've arranged your affairs.~
@38   = ~I... I am... This is very generous, my <PRO_LADYLORD>....~
@39   = ~Coran, I wish... I wish it could have been different, but I can't make you love me, not without my sorcery. *smiles softly* And who needs love instigated by magic?~
@40   = ~Coran? Do not you even want to see Namara? She has your eyes... elven eyes.~
@41   = ~I curse the day I laid my eyes on you, Coran.~
@42   = ~And... thank you for sending that no good thief my way. *sighs dreamily* He is not *that* bad, actually.~
@43   = ~Ahem, Briel... I did a lot of thinking and... I've come to apologize, Briel...~
@44   = ~Apologize? What do I need an apology for? Would it put food on Namara's plate and clothes on her back? Or should I sing your apology as a lullaby for her, when she will not stop crying for her father?~
@45   = ~Eh, Briel, slow down! I came to offer my help as well. I know, that we disagree about my... hmm... lifestyle, and that you are too noble to be a thief's mate...~
@46   = ~Coran, why must you be so incredibly stubborn about it? You are going to end up in prison or hanged for a bandit, silly Elf. I know you have a better heart than that... why would not you...~
@47   = ~Briel, Briel... Please, let us spare <CHARNAME> the further details of our favorite argument. The City of Baldur's Gate needs something newer than that to listen to. I am not cut out to become a merchant or some other respectable member of society.~
@48   = ~A pity...~
@49   = ~Maybe. Briel, I promise you that every time I come into money, Namara and you will have... ~
@50   = ~I see. Coran, I feel that you are sincere, and that you do want to help. However, I am afraid that will not be enough, not with your peculiar notion on what responsibility is. I have an idea, though, on how you can help.~
@51   = ~What would you have me do, Briel? I agree to anything, except for settling down, of course.~
@52   = ~It has been rough going for us lately with Namara sick and my husband plotting against us... He took it all, Coran! House, money, everything. I can hardly get by, and I am so tired... Would you take Namara with you and take care of her for a while to give me some time to get back on my feet?~
@53   = ~Huh, Briel... are you sure? I lack knowledge on baby care. I doubt that I can... you know... feed the baby and... and do whatever else you have to do. Actually, I know nothing of babies at all.~
@54   = ~Then it is past time that you learnt. She is now at an age when she does not require breast feeding, and I have here a book of helpful hints...~
@55   = ~Briel! Not that I refuse, but won't it be dangerous for a child to travel with me? We are constantly fighting for our lives and...~
@56   = ~It is no more dangerous for her in your company than in that place in the bowels of this city I keep her now... I never know that she won't be sold to some slavers or killed out of spite by some lowlife while I am away... Coran, desperate people cannot be choosy.~
@57   = ~Would you want to travel with me then? I am sure <CHARNAME>...~
@58   = ~No, Coran, I will not be a part of a mercenary group, and I would not go about robbing people with you. My reputation is ruined as is. If you want to help - take care of Namara for a bit...~
@59   = ~Well, if that's what you want me to do, I will do it.~
@60   = ~Good. Thank you, Coran. And do not look so sour, you might come to enjoy it, after all. Here is the book, and I will bring Namara in a moment.~
