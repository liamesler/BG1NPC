@0    = ~Hey!~
@1    = ~Oh! Scared me, you did! I suppose I'm caught, then? I'll go peacefully, I'm not much for fighting... Wait a minute... Holy Leapin' Lavender Lizards! You're not the guard! You're... you're burglaring, just like me! Now this *is* exciting! We should... we should work together! Yeah! I could use the help... uh... I mean, we could just help each other a little bit. Just for this one heist, you keep watch while I point out the good stuff. You can even keep most of it! I got a good tip on where to be looking! Whatcha say?~
@2    = ~That is a good idea. I'll keep watch and help you.~
@3    = ~I have no interest in a thief so easily caught. Off with you!~
@4    = ~You've seen me! I'm sorry, but I have to kill you now!~
@5    = ~Holy Kitty Cacophony, you scared the bejeebbers outta me! Sure it's yer job to catch us thievers, but ye need not give me a heart attack too! Hey... you're not the guard! Yeesh! Getting me all in a tizzy when you're here for the same thing as me. Well, since you're here, howz about we work together? Just for this one heist, I mean. You keep watch while I show the stash. I know a secret here and there, but we get equal shares, OK?~
@6    = ~A good plan. Do what you must and I'll keep watch.~
@7    = ~Wha...! Aww, nutbunnies, caught again! Hey, wait... there's no polish on yer boots, no snap in yer suspenders. You're... you're not the guard. They're always so much more... presentable. Well... be on your way, then. I just wanna grab a few things and... be off. There's lots for both of us, so leave me be. Hmph... not so much fun if just anyone can bust in here.~
@8    = ~Just you leave me to my sneakin'. I'm not gonna take the big stuff.~
@9    = ~Well if your gonna be puppy-doggin after me all night, maybe we should work together. I know this place pretty good; know a few secrets. Could be fun. What say you? Wanna keep watch while I scout for pretties?~
@10   = ~Certainly. Do what you must while I will keep watch.~
@11   = ~Well! There's no need to be rude about it! Hmph! Never meet nice people in this line of work! No wonder people hate thieves! Well, we steal stuff too, *but being jerks doesn't help*! Not one bit! Goodbye!~
@12   = ~Double good and done! Oh, it'll be great fun having someone around to talk to! I don't meet many nice people in this trade. Just because we steal doesn't mean we have to be bad. Mostly I'm just curious what people have. Here, I'll point out a few things and then we can get to sneakin.' He he, such fun!~
@13   = ~Pretty good takin's with none too many bruises. We do pretty good for just meeting! How about we do this again, like all the time? Wanna join up permanent?~
@14   = ~A splendid idea! Welcome aboard.~
@15   = ~I really am sorry, but we've all we need. ~
@16   = ~Laughable! What do I need you for? Our job is done, now get lost!~
@17   = ~Ah well, easy go, I guess. Never get to keep my friends in this biz. Specially the nice ones. Bye, I guess.~
@18   = ~Friends we are, and nice ones too! One for all and things like that! Fun for all of us, I just *know* it!~
@19   = ~I'm just a thief. Sorry, but I don't have much to tell.~
@20   = ~Ahh! I can't fight ya, but I'll call the guard, I will! Rather be in jail than dead from you! Help! Nasty, mean and evil!! ~
@21   = ~Ahh! I can't fight ya, but I'll call the guard, I will! Rather be in jail than dead from you! Help! Nasty, mean and evil!~
@22   = ~If that's the way you want it, then fine, I'll leave! *sniff*~
@23   = ~I don't wanna go, but if yer gonna force me, then I guess I'll just mope around here 'till you come back to your senses and come back for me.~
