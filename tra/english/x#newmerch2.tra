@3    = ~I've heard a lot of stuff lately. Iron seems to be hard to come by, what with the bandits and the faulty Nashkel ore. Trouble seems to be brewing between Baldur's Gate and Amn. I wouldn't be too surprised, if a war broke out between the two.~
@4    = ~When I charmed a merchant, he said some vague things about iron shortages, bandits and war.~
@5    = ~I wouldn't trust you as far as I can spit!~
