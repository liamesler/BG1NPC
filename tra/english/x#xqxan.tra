@0    = ~P-please, have mercy!~ [SLAVE02]
@1    = ~Speak to Skodd here. He is our leader.~ [SLAVE02]
@2    = ~Be kind, we are but poor merchants that barely escaped with their lives from the bandits, and now we need to find the way through the lands of this basilisk-breeding psychopath.~ [SLAVE02]
@3    = ~All our goods are gone...~
@4    = ~Hail, adventurers. Please, let us be. We were left with nothing but the clothes at our backs.~
@5    = ~Then you will be pleased to know that I have dealt with the basilisk infestation. The road is clear for you.~
@6    = ~The foul beasts and their evil master are dead. Both Flaming Fist and the mercenary groups like mine had been dealing with the threat of banditry for a while now, and I dare say that you should find the roads less dangerous. If needed, I shall escort you to Baldur's Gate myself.~
@7    = ~Ha! Then I guess I will have to be satisfied with your clothes!~
@8    = ~Next time you should hire more reliable guards, then. Or be less frugal with mercenaries.~
@9    = ~Really? And that's why you are hanging around in the woods?~
@10   = ~We... we were scattered after the attack.~
@11   = ~And only now sought each other out.~
@12   = ~Pure truth, pure truth indeed.~
@13   = ~This is indeed great news.~
@14   = ~If this is the case, we can make it to Baldur's Gate on our own, kind stranger.~
@15   = ~We will defend what we have left, don't you ever doubt that.~
@16   = ~Indeed, in the future we shall hire help. Now, we must attend to saving our meager lives.~
@17   = ~We cannot offer much of a reward now, but if you tell us your name, we'll make sure to report to the Dukes of Baldur's Gate about your honest service to the road travelers.~
@18   = ~My name is <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep.~
@19   = ~It is very kind of you to offer, but I prefer to remain anonymous.~
@20   = ~I serve goodness, not fame. If you happen to pass by a temple of a goodly deity when luck smiles at you, just give some coin to the priest. That will be a sufficient reward for me.~
@21   = ~Thank you again, and good travels to you.~
@22   = ~Mercy, I beg you of mercy, though you have shown none.~ [ELSOL101]
@23   = ~They did not deserve mercy! They... they lied when they said that the bandits left them without goods to sell...We are the *goods*...*sob* the slaves...~
@24   = ~Silence! If we are to be passed from hands to hands as a booty, we should at least keep our dignity and not to humiliate ourselves with - ~
@25   = ~Look, Minuwiel! *points at Xan*~
@26   = ~*The maiden's eyes go wide as her gaze falls upon Xan.* Moonblade wielder!~
@27   = ~We are saved!~
@28   = ~We beg for thy protection, my lord. *All three kneel.*~
@29   = ~I... *clears his throat*~
@30   = ~<CHARNAME>, these women have placed themselves under my protection. I will defend them... *sigh* if needs be, while my hand is capable of wielding the sword.~
@31   = ~Although, of course, my obligations to you come first and foremost.~
@32   = ~*sigh* The defender of Elvendom calls upon you to help him in his mission.~
@33   = ~As the Defender of Elvendom commands, so I shall do.~
@34   = ~But <CHARNAME> would never hurt such pretty ladies! All right, Xan, stop this Evereskan act, no matter how fine it is. You know that I would not leave a damsel in distress!~
@35   = ~<CHARNAME>?~
@36   = ~There is no need to act so dramatically, Xan. I would not harm our kin. You are free to go, ladies.~
@37   = ~There is no need to act so dramatically, Xan. I would not harm them. You are free to go, ladies.~
@38   = ~Elves and their peculiarities... I am so tired of that. You can have it your way, Xan, but do not you dare to pester me again into do-gooding. *spit on the ground*~
@39   = ~These three elven whores will make a fine entertainment after a long day of slaughter...~
@40   = ~But they are a part of the booty, and rightfully belong to us!~
@41   = ~I am in no mood for arguments. I am letting them go.~
@42   = ~I'd let them go... but you will owe me for that, Xan. Does a moonblade wielder pay his debts?~
@43   = ~There was an aura of evil around these "merchants"; that is why I did not hesitate to attack them. But I did not know that it would all turn out quite so well! Heh, a fine slaughter and a noble deed to boot! Go me! Now, I hope that they lied about *only clothes on their backs*.~
@44   = ~It is... settled, then. Flee with all speed, dear sisters, do not take this sliver of luck for more than it is - a mere exception for the rule.~
@45   = ~Thank you! We are saved!~
@46   = ~But the roads are dangerous...~
@47   = ~Are we near to any city, where we can plead for sanctuary?~
@48   = ~The Friendly Arm Inn is a day's journey west of here. The owners are gnomish, but they hold the place safe for all people of good will. We would escort you, if <CHARNAME>...~
@49   = ~We will all accompany you.~
@50   = ~You can escort them, Xan. Wait for me in the Friendly Arm Inn afterwards.~
@51   = ~I am afraid this is impossible.~
@52   = ~I cannot spare you, Xan. I am sure that the ladies here learned a valuable lesson and will be more capable of defending themselves from now on. Fare you three well, and try to stay out of trouble.~
@53   = ~You would put their safety above mine? Fine, go, take them wherever you wish, never mind my wounds!~
@54   = ~How... how dare you! These are no whores, but honest elven maidens...~
@55   = ~Perhaps I have been too curt. I apologize.~
@56   = ~It wouldn't take much to change this, eh? *grin unpleasantly*~
@57   = ~Oh, forgive me... not whores, of course, but bed slaves.~
@58   = ~Women... and not whores? Elves and their peculiarities... I am so tired of that! You can have it your way, Xan, but do not you dare to pester me again into do-gooding again. *spit on the ground*~
@59   = ~I warn you, you will only claim this ownership after you have stepped over my...*sighs heavily* corpse.~
@60   = ~Have you taken leave of your senses, <CHARNAME>? Never I have thought you to be a slaver.~
@61   = ~Entangling woman with your charm is one thing. But this?~
@62   = ~Wh-what are you saying! G-gods have mercy upon me for s-saying so, but good thing G-Gorion is dead and cannot hear you!~
@63   = ~It is a joke in a *very* bad taste, <CHARNAME>, but I *do* hope it is a joke.~
@64   = ~All right, have it your way. Go, women, before I have changed my mind.~
@65   = ~I do not think that stepping over your corpse is a necessary part of the deal. Simply turning you into one should suffice.~
@66   = ~Ye want a fight? Then ye got a fight!~
@67   = ~Xan of Evereska pays his debts. *bows formally* I will do your bidding, <CHARNAME>, if you set the women free.~
@68   = ~Ah, do not cringe, my sweet moonblade wielder. You might actually like the payment I have in mind for you. Go, silly women, before I have changed my mind.~
@69   = ~Sounds promising, my dear... Very well, they are free to go.~
@70   = ~It's a deal, then. The women are free to go.~
@71   = ~It's a bargain, since I am guaranteed to get a service out of you, but you did not ask me to preserve the women's lives, once they are free... They will most probably just die on some orcs' swords... or in their bedrolls.~
@72   = ~Nay, I changed me mind. 'Twill be much more profitable to sell 'em.~
@73   = ~*sigh* You leave me little choice. And I thought you were a friend...~
@74   = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@75   = ~It shall be as you say. *sigh* This, or you will find four burnt and mutilated corpses in the woods soon enough.~
@76   = ~Come, sisters. May the Seldarine guide us, for, alas, without some divine luck we are as good as dead.~
@77   = ~<CHARNAME>, I shall be awaiting you in the Friendly Arm Inn.~
@78   = ~*sigh* I fear you will have to manage on your own, ladies. Fare you well.~
@79   = ~Come, sisters. We have no time to waste.~
@80   = ~Thank you, my lord, and you, dear <PRO_MANWOMAN>...~
@81   = ~Perhaps we will meet again.~
@82   = ~Wait! Please... I am feeling... odd...~
@83   = ~It... it seems that magical energies flow between me and the Moonblade. It happens when the blade acknowledges its new wielder... but what could I have done to deserve such an honor?~
@84   = ~Wait! Please... I am feeling... weak...~
@85   = ~Moonblade... Oooh!~
@86   = ~*sigh* And so my just punishment comes to be. If I fail just one more time, my moonblade will go dormant - Seldarine's gift will be despoiled. Have you freed me for better or for worse, <CHARNAME>? Will I ever redeem myself in your company?~
@87   = ~I... I thought that your foes had better luck, <CHARNAME>. But my doom is inevitable, no matter what side I choose.~
@88   = ~It does not have to be this way, Xan! You had sworn fealty to me, and you rebelled. Do you want to die a traitor and an oath-breaker, or do you want to live to redeem yourself?~
@89   = ~Do you yield, elf?~
@90   = ~Ha, this whining reminds me why I thought it would be so great to kill you in the first place!~
@91   = ~Mercy, my <LADYLORD>. I shall not betray you again.~
@92   = ~You disgraced yourself, my liege <LADYLORD>. The Seldarine will judge me.~
@93   = ~*bitterly* No, I am not yielding. I am dying undefeated... Another man to throw away his life in a hopeless defense of the righteousness. How droll.~
@94   = ~It matters not. I am dying undefeated... Another man to throw away his life in hopeless defense of the righteousness. How droll.~
@95   = ~*A white doe approaches Xan, looks at him attentively with its moist red eyes and touches his hand with its nose.*~ [X#BLANK]
@96   = ~A rare sight...~
@97   = ~<CHARNAME>, much as I detest engaging us in yet another pointless endeavor, I feel that this doe signifies something. Let us follow it.~
@98   = ~*morosely* I thought that we had discussed the matter in full.~ [SLAVE02]
@99   = ~I see three elven women with their hands bound. I demand an explanation.~
@100  = ~I have the same question as Xan: what do these women do in your midst? Why are their faces bruised, and their clothes in rags?~
@101  = ~I do not think we even started to discuss the matter, fiend! Now answer Xan's question, and make it a good answer!~
@102  = ~Shut up, Xan. So, it seems that you have found the rest of your... erm, party, my good, erm... merchant. I guess I'll just walk around you very carefully...~
@103  = ~Xan, the man is right. We *have* discussed what needed to be discussed. Now we go onward and mind our own business.~
@104  = ~Please, good <PRO_MANWOMAN>! You are our last hope of salvation...~ [ELSOL101]
@105  = ~We plead to you to free us.~
@106  = ~Please...~
@107  = ~<CHARNAME>, you are not my kin, but one does not have to be a Tel'Quessir to free those who were captured and robbed of their dignity. *sigh* Fight with me, and we will keep our honor, if not our lives.~
@108  = ~<CHARNAME>, as a moonblade wielder I call upon thee to help me to try to liberate our sisters. *sigh* Fight with me, and we will keep our honor, if not our lives.~
@109  = ~*firmly* These ill-trained women are my rightful possessions. I am transporting them to be sold in Calimport in good faith. You and your slanted-eyed companion have no call to interfere with my business.~
@110  = ~These women are SLAVES?! You have my sword, moonblade wielder!~
@111  = ~I can buy them from you.~
@112  = ~You see, Xan, it's all sorted itself out. We cannot impose our moral values onto a man from Calimshan. He abides by different laws, and he did not breach them. Why, I am sure he even has proper papers! Even if he did, Xan... it is not us who should deal out punishment to him. We can file a complaint next time we pass through Baldur's Gate. They are surely *much* better equipped then us to deal with these... one... three... five... six heavily armed ferocious fighters.~
@113  = ~*look at Xan* These women pleaded with you, moonblade wielder. I give you the command over my party and over myself.~
@114  = ~Xan... I cannot. There are too many of them. We will all die here.~
@115  = ~But what about the Iron Throne? If we fall here, many more will remain slaves... and Gorion's murderer will not be brought to justice.~
@116  = ~Cool down, Xan. Hmm... how much I can offer you for this lot, Skodd?~
@117  = ~Is it morally right to rob a merchant of his goods if the goods are people? My heart is saying yes, but that may rank us with the bandits we are hunting...~
@118  = ~The possible complications between the humans of Calimshan and Baldur's Gate would no doubt be blamed on elves... and through me, injustice and grief will befall my kin...~
@119  = ~*sigh* As badly outnumbered as we are, we will die on their swords, failing to free the women, and proving nothing but our own stupidity. I concur, <CHARNAME>. We will warn the Dukes of this party.~
@120  = ~*Xan turns to elven prisoners.* You have heard my liege <LADYLORD>. I will obey <PRO_HISHER> command, and the matter will be handled, as <PRO_HESHE> desires. Alas, I am powerless to help you on my own.~
@121  = ~Good to see you showing some sense. Follow me, men!~
@122  = ~We will defend our property, don't you ever doubt that.~
@123  = ~Then you shall stand with me in this hopeless enterprise? You are as much of a fool as I... But what choice do we have?~
@124  = ~It is not the money that is at stake here, it is my reputation. I am bound to deliver my cargo on time. My business will suffer a great deal in lost future profits if the buyers consider me unreliable.~
@125  = ~*Skodd looks at you thoughtfully.*~
@126  = ~<CHARNAME>, this man will trade you the three women and will immediately go back and capture other unfortunate souls.~
@127  = ~If only you had three elven males with you, ready for trade... but never mind.~
@128  = ~We will be on our way, and you will follow yours. Do we have an understanding?~
@129  = ~No, and we shall never have! Defend yourself!~
@130  = ~Xan... We cannot impose our moral values onto a man from Calimshan. He abides by different laws, and he did not breach them. Why, I am sure he even has proper papers! Even if he did, Xan... it is not us who should deal out punishment to him. We can file a complaint next time we pass through Baldur's Gate. They are surely *much* better equipped then us to deal with these... one... three... six... nine heavily armed ferocious fighters and accomplished spellcasters.~
@131  = ~Xan... we must go. There are too many of them. We will all die here.~
@132  = ~But... I can offer you a deal.  A trade... so to speak.~
@133  = ~You see, female elven slaves are not that rare, while male ones are much more costly and desirable. And difficult to catch in undamaged condition.~
@134  = ~*sigh* Do you want me in exchange for the women?~
@135  = ~I would not trade at a loss. Head for head is more to my liking. And if you come willingly.~
@136  = ~Trade us, <CHARNAME>. *Kivan throws a quick glance at Coran.* Coran?~
@137  = ~*A mischievous grin curves Coran's lips, and he rises his brow at Kivan.* Of course! That's going to be quite an adventure to travel to Calimport.~
@138  = ~Perfect. Just perfect. First I was imprisoned in dismal lightless caves, now I am going to be a slave...~
@139  = ~A *bed* slave, Xan. It makes all the difference in the world, does it not, Kiv?~
@140  = ~*stiffly* Yes, a dream come true, no less.~
@141  = ~Not mine. *sigh* <CHARNAME>... do not look at me like that. Do you understand *what* we are about to do?~
@142  = ~*grin* Yes, I think I do.~
@143  = ~I refuse to understand. Do not talk to me.~
@144  = ~Just... be careful.~
@145  = ~You are going to leave the group, and I do not like this at all!~
@146  = ~Yes, you are going to sacrifice yourself needlessly!~
@147  = ~*sigh* Are we all ready?~
@148  = ~<CHARNAME>... *grin* You will not forget me?~
@149  = ~I do not want to talk to you, elf.~
@150  = ~*You return Coran's grin.* Never, my love.~
@151  = ~*You crush any doubts. Coran loves you, no matter what he was just saying.* I won't.~
@152  = ~*Coran gives you a pained glance, which pleads your forgiveness. Or at least it looks like such.*~
@153  = ~Alright. Drop your weapons and let us exchange the slaves.~
@154  = ~Shevarash, give us strength!~
@155  = ~Oh, Hanali...~
@156  = ~And now we... charge! Oh, Corellon, what am I saying? Are you with us, <CHARNAME>?~
@157  = ~Yes! I stand with you! Attack!~
@158  = ~You are on your own, noble fools!~
@159  = ~What a show! I will sit aside and enjoy the slaughter of fools. Always a welcome sight.~
@160  = ~What are you... oh, to hell with it. Charge!~
@161  = ~You have tried to trick me, offering spoiled goods! That is most dishonest and should be punished. I hope that I can recover my losses out of the spoils after I kill you.~
@162  = ~Ah, you are still alive! You will be pleased to know that Siene, Diala and Minuwiel accepted protection from a tribe of wild elves.~
@163  = ~*sigh* And here I was starting to hope that you decided to solve the iron shortage puzzle on your own, <CHARNAME>. But, alas, it seems that I have to continue walking the narrow chasm in your company, trying not to fall to my death.~
@164  = ~Although sometimes it seems almost... passable.~
@165  = ~We cannot express our gratitude in mere words... but thank you for all you have done.~
