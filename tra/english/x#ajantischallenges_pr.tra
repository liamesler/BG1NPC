@0    = ~Entertain you, my lady? I am trying to imagine what a lady like you would like for her entertainment. Should I recite a poem? You most probably heard a better one in the halls of Candlekeep. Should I tell you a story? You most probably read a better one in the great library. Should I give you a fighting performance? There are enough battles in your life, and it is hardly romantic enough to fill such a lady's evening.~
@1    = ~I surely wish I could take you to Waterdeep, my lady, but that is too far away for now... So I have decided to present you with something very special and rarely available. See what delight can be achieved through the combination of magic and craft work! Gond the Wonderbringer, deity of craft, construction, and smithwork, brought smoke powder to the Lantanese during the times of troubles. It found its way here, in little packages that draw colorful sparks across the sky when lighted. But I do not want to talk too much, my lady. See for yourself...~
@2    = ~I hope you enjoyed the sight, my lady. It was a pleasure for the moment, and hopefully the kind of entertainment you enjoy. I put fast burning fires of great might into the sky to impress you, my lady... hoping that you will be able to see the glowing, steadily burning fire inside my heart... *ahem* Although the first might be impressive to look at, it was over very soon. My steady flame will keep you warm for the rest of your life... if you want it to, lovely <CHARNAME>.~
@3    = ~My lady, you ask of me a gift... yes, there is a gift I would like to give to you, beautiful <CHARNAME>. It will be nothing you can see, nothing you can touch. And yet it is something that you could call your own for the rest of your life, if you accept it.~
@4    = ~<CHARNAME>, what I give to you is this: I will protect you and fight for you with all the might Helm has given me. I will walk the path of goodness with you, and just as my powers protect you against evil now, they will protect you for the rest of your life, if you want them to. If... you want *me* to, my lady. I am your humble servant, lovely and brave woman.~
@5    = ~How would I save you from a dragon, my lady? With all my might, I assure you. If time would allow, I would first do research. This is more important than you might think. It is not without reason that Helm posted the dogma "Know your foes. Careful planning always defeats rushed actions in the end". As dragons are such powerful enemies, in this case it would be crucial to know what kind of dragon you were captured by, and what life phase it is in. Dragon's powers differ depending on their age: Would it be a young dragon, an old dragon, or a wyrm?~
@6    = ~Do you happen to know that there are ten races of true dragons? There are five chromatic ones: black, blue, green, red, and white. And there are five metallic: brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver. All of them can grow to giant wyrms. They gain immunity to non-magical weapons, as well as to spells that put them to sleep or result in paralysis. All of them are immune to at least one type of elemental energy such as cold, fire, acid, or electricity, depending on which type the dragon uses for its breath weapon. This, of course, also reveals the weakness of every dragon, as they often prove vulnerable to attacks involving the opposite element!~
@7    = ~After gathering knowledge about whom I have to attack, I would recruit helpers. Do not think that I am too afraid to face such a danger alone, my lady. But there is no use in running into a fight unprepared, and doing it alone would mean exactly that. If available, I would take along at least one cleric, who could heal our wounds and bless the party with his protections.~
@8    = ~Then I would approach the dragon, my lady. And it could be that it goes like this...~
@9    = ~This of course was... not serious, my lady, as this was a silver dragon. Surely you know that silver dragons, like all metallic dragons, are usually friendly and helpful towards humans... I am sorry, but I could not resist. *coughs*~
@10   = ~When asking me how I would save you from a dragon, surely you were thinking about such a kind as a red dragon, the most wicked and fierce of the chromatic dragons, and especially suitable for this example, as they tend to capture *ahem* young maidens to eat... In this case, all the preparations I already listed would be crucial, as red dragons are very powerful enemies.~
@11   = ~I assure you, my lady: If there was no time for careful planning, I would approach the dragon alone to save you. If all I had was a wooden stick, my lady, I *still* would fight the dragon to save you. I would fight for your escape with all the might Helm has given me. I would give my life for yours: Never shall an evil creature lay hands on you while I am near you, lovely and brave <CHARNAME>!~
@12   = ~Greetings, mighty lady. I seek your forgiveness for the disturbance.~
@13   = ~Greetings, my human friend. What is your desire that leads your steps here?~
@14   = ~Silver light on silver scales,
Flashes high above the dales,
Like mithril shining in the night
Reflects the glow of pale moonlight.
As graceful as elven bards do sing,
Silver dragons soar on silver wings.~
@15   = ~It is <CHARNAME> I am here for, my lady. I hope you do not mind if I take her away from your blessed company.~
@16   = ~Not at all, my human friend. I enjoyed her presence but I know you human folk always have to hurry on... So fare well, <CHARNAME>, and might your life be prosperous.~
