@0    = ~My lady, I see you on the path of good, but I am not fully satisfied yet. If you are interested in my advice, we need to focus on doing good deeds and helping those in need we meet on our way.~
@1    = ~My love, we have been doing evil deeds! People are speaking your name with less respect than before. What happened to our path of good and righteousness? We have to turn back to the right path immediately!~
@2    = ~<CHARNAME>, I cannot agree with the way we are treating the people seeking our help. I see you making bad decisions and turning down pleas for aid. This is not the way we should behave on our glorious search!~
@3    = ~<CHARNAME>, you keep on walking on the wrong path! I cannot accept the way you treat people. I thought you were different, but it seems I was wrong. Duty tells me to draw against you. Defend yourself, as I will fight the evil that is in you!~
@4    = ~Ajantis turned hostile

Ajantis attacked me, saying he can't accept how I treat people. I had to kill him; he left me no choice.~
@5    = ~My lady, I... overheard that you were raised by Gorion, a well known keeper of Candlekeep library, and that he was murdered by criminals. Let me express my deepest sorrow for your loss.~
@6    = ~Thank you for your kind words, Ajantis. Gorion was my father, and my mentor. I will not stop until I find the ones responsible for his murder!~
@7    = ~Gorion died while defending me... But, what makes it even worse, is the fact *I* was the one they were after, not Gorion.~
@8    = ~It's alright, dwelling on it will not bring him back.~
@9    = ~Thank you, Ajantis. When they took Gorion from me... I am sorry, Ajantis. I cannot talk about this any longer. It is just too upsetting for me.~
@10   = ~Where exactly did you 'overhear' this?~
@11   = ~Thank you, Ajantis. I would prefer not to talk about this.~
@12   = ~Ajantis, I don't need this kind of personal talk!~
@13   = ~My lady, I fully understand your feelings of grief and pain. But do not let your senses be overwhelmed by revenge and hate. You can only hope to hunt down these murderers if you are not blinded by hate and you do not let revenge affect your fighting prowess.~
@14   = ~You mean our unknown enemy might have an interest in you?~
@15   = ~Maybe I am just being paranoid. Let us go and find these bandits. Whatever the future holds, it will be revealed in due time.~
@16   = ~Well, it seemed like it... But I don't have any idea why this should be, Ajantis.~
@17   = ~Well... 'Hand over your ward and no one will be hurt. If you resist it shall be a waste of your life.' That's what the armored figured said when it attacked us. That sure sounds like interest to me, Ajantis.~
@18   = ~Of course it will not, my lady...~
@19   = ~Of course, my lady. I am sorry to have upset you.~
@20   = ~That is very strange indeed, my lady.~
@21   = ~This of course is a strong motivation for you to hunt down the bandits here on the Sword Coast, my lady. I can only confirm what I already said to you. Be assured of my assistance in this dangerous task. Let us proceed and find the murderers of your foster father!~
@22   = ~You were muttering in your sleep, my lady... I am sorry, I did not mean to sound intrusive.~
@23   = ~Thank you, Ajantis. When they took Gorion from me... I am sorry, Ajantis. I can not talk about this any longer. It is just too upsetting for me.~
@24   = ~Keep your nosey ears to yourself from now on, Ajantis. I don't need this kind of personal talk!~
@25   = ~Then I will keep my thoughts to myself from now on, my lady. Let us continue with our duty.~
@26   = ~Of course, my lady. I am sorry to have raised this sad issue.~
@27   = ~Lady <CHARNAME>! It is good to see you again. Surely I can join you now?~
@28   = ~I am sorry, you will have to wait a bit longer, Ajantis.~
@29   = ~Yes, please do join.~
@30   = ~As you wish, <CHARNAME>. I shall wait.~
