@0    = ~Dost thou miss Candlekeep, <CHARNAME>? Surely, thou art not as far afield from thy home as I am, but do thine eyes turn in its direction and fill with tears sometimes?~
@1    = ~To tell you the truth, Dynaheir, everything is happening at such a fast pace that I have no chance to miss the library.~
@2    = ~I still walk my native land, Dynaheir. Rashemen is far farther from here than Candlekeep. Say, where is it, by the way?~
@3    = ~I do not miss the place, but strangely enough I miss the people, bunch of weirdos that they were...~
@4    = ~I miss Candlekeep sorely, and I hope to return there as soon as I am able to find a rare book or collect 10,000 gold pieces!~
@5    = ~Do you really care?~
@6    = ~I understand. Thou art excited with thy first adventure and this conceals all other worries.~
@7    = ~Erm... something like that. Let us go now, Dynaheir.~
@8    = ~Excited? Of course I am excited! Dynaheir, I am about to become the greatest hero this country has known in centuries! I am the noble avenger hunting the murderer of my father! I am... I am...~
@9    = ~Nope. All of my thinking ability goes into watching out for myself, Dynaheir. I have no time to daydream if I want to stay alive, and in the night I either have terrible nightmares, or I sleep ready to get up and fight... So it's the worries that conceal everything.~
@10   = ~Rashemen layeth east of here, almost a season's travel, by sea and by land. Betwixt Thay and Ashanath it is. My land is severe and intense, very unlike this mild region. But I bore thee with my mumbling. Let us walk again.~
@11   = ~People are part of any land and help form our impression of it. Oft we must wonder whether it is the land that changeth people, or people who changeth the land.~
@12   = ~Thou hast to pay such an enormous fee to visit thine own city of birth?~
@13   = ~*shrug* Supposedly, it helps to keep peace inside of the library, but the latest events... well, whatever.~
@14   = ~That is correct. I could not even return to bury my foster father properly!~
@15   = ~It was not I who set the rule. This is how it has always been, Dynaheir.~
@16   = ~Yes, I do. But I can see that thou dost not care for telling.~
@17   = ~These boots were made for walking, and that's just what they'll do.~ [%tutu_var%DYNAH32]
@18   = ~Thou art not finishing thy sentence. What art thou?~
@19   = ~A fool who reads too many tales. Stop staring at me, I am done talking. Let's go.~
@20   = ~I do not know myself, but I think I am something... someone... special.~
@21   = ~I think that the 'brooding, mysterious and smashing-looking avenger' describes it adequately, though still falls far from the truth.~
@22   = ~I wish I knew myself.~
@23   = ~Thou hast nightmares? Pity, that one as young as thyself suffers from worries. 'Tis true that few places are presently safe, but should we find such, I counsel thee to rest for a day or two.~
@24   = ~Something hath happened recently that thou fear'st for the safety of Candlekeep?~
@25   = ~Yeah... You see, assassins came after me, right there, in Candlekeep. From the look of them they were not the sort to rub more than two coppers together, and they were not of the townsfolk. Somehow they must have slipped past the guards.~
@26   = ~Dynaheir, frankly, it is none of your business.~
@27   = ~'Tis a shame indeed. One ne'er should be denied such a thing.~
@28   = ~Neither time nor habit changeth folly into wisdom. I reckon that thy Candlekeep robs itself of much commerce in that way.~
@29   = ~Thou may'st very well be, <CHARNAME>.~
@30   = ~Do you know anything about me?~
@31   = ~Dynaheir, should I ask you what do you mean by that, you are going to give me a cryptic answer. Am I right?~
@32   = ~The roads to greatness are many. Now, let us resume travel, lest we never find ours.~
@33   = ~Smashing-looking? I would call thee handsome, but if thou insist'st on words I have no knowledge of, I shall abide by thy wish. <CHARNAME>, the Smashing-Looking I shall call thee in my notes.~
@34   = ~Woman, thou speak'st like a rash youth. Respect thyself and thy station.~
@35   = ~*nods absently* Yes, 'tis knowledge that might prove of great interest.~
@36   = ~Dynaheir, I wanted to ask for a while now: do you know more about me than you would lead me to believe?~
@37   = ~Or someone paid for their entrance. Thou seem'st to have powerful and unrelenting enemies, <CHARNAME>. Be wary.~
@38   = ~I am wary. By all gods, living and dead, I am the wariest person ever!~
@39   = ~It must be some mistake... I am... well, just a youth, trying to climb the ladder of the world. People like me are a copper a dozen!~
@40   = ~If you want to help, tell me what you know of me instead of giving me hints and cryptic looks!~
@41   = ~Mayhap, thou art right. Then again, maybe not...~
@42   = ~The only thing I know is that I know nothing. It might be that I have a suspicion of sorts about thee. However... 'Tis a difficult matter, old and unclear. Should I reveal it to thee, it would serve only to give thee more doubts.~
@43   = ~Indeed, indeed.~
@44   = ~'Tis good. Thou art wise beyond thy years.~
@45   = ~Dost thou know much of who I am? Of Hathran?~
@46   = ~Of Rashemi witches? You are one, and you are a great mage. That's all I know, and all I need to know of Hathran, Dynaheir.~
@47   = ~Hathran? Erm, can you spell it?~
@48   = ~I thought you were a witch... Hey, don't kill the messenger!~
@49   = ~Did you not call yourself a Wychlaran?~
@50   = ~The full absence of curiosity is not commendable amongst my sisters. Peculiarly, so is its excess.~
@51   = ~With greatest pleasure. Where can my ink-bottle be? Ah, here it is: Ha-th-ran. 'Tis in Common tongue of course.~
@52   = ~Good. Now I know how to spell it. That's enough of the educational activities for the day. Back to the hack-n-slash!~
@53   = ~So, what is Hathran?~
@54   = ~Added to my previous knowledge that you are a kick-ass mage, it is all I need to know of Hathran.~
@55   = ~Oft we are called witches. But betwixt ourselves we are called Hathran. Simply, Hathran are all women with a gift for the Arts. The Unproven are women that were not trained in the Arts. The Ethran are the trained, the Hathran are senior amongst us, and the Othlor are the wisest and most honored.~
@56   = ~Thank you, Dynaheir. That was very interesting.~
@57   = ~Whatever. Excuse me, for I need to move, lest I grow roots.~
@58   = ~And the most senior of you is called Amyrlin Seat. Right?~
@59   = ~Indeed, Wychlaran is commonly used. A more polite form is Hathran, but either is appropriate. Simply, Hathran are all women with a gift for the Arts. The Unproven are women that were not trained in the arts. The Ethran are the trained, the Hathran are senior amongst us, and the Othlor are the wisest and most honored.~
@60   = ~Thank you, Dynaheir. It was very interesting.~
@61   = ~Thou art lively of body. 'Tis a pity that thy mind lacks agility.~
@62   = ~'Tis pleasing to know that thou art interested in the lore of distant lands. Many people I met were only disposed to listen of themselves and their own.~
@63   = ~Thou must be confusing some foreign custom for Rashemi. No single Hathran is in charge of all the others.~
@64   = ~Minsc is nothing if not the most loyal companion! Many a time I was grateful for him traveling with me.~
@65   = ~Oh... So should it be a fairy tale ending then? After traveling far and wide they returned home, got married and lived happily ever after?~
@66   = ~I appreciate Minsc's company myself. And yours. Truly, I consider both of you my friends now, even if I have not known you for long.~
@67   = ~Maybe, but I'd be cautious if I were you. They do not say without reason, 'It is better to have an enemy than a foolish ally.'~
@68   = ~Not all who are friends would marry.~
@69   = ~Come on, a man for whom the hamster does all the thinking! That's an ideal for women all over Faerun!~
@70   = ~C'mon, a man for whom the hamster does all the thinking! That's an ideal for women all over Faerun!~
@71   = ~I take it you do not fancy Minsc. I wonder if you can fancy anyone at all...~
@72   = ~I do not believe you! Why, you were practically mooning over Minsc the other night! And the way he is going crazy every time someone dares to look your way, let alone attack you!~
@73   = ~Really? That's great! Erm... I did not mean to intrude, but are you attached otherwise? Is there any man besides Minsc and Boo in your life?~
@74   = ~That is my feeling towards thee as well. On the road friendships are quickly forged and cemented firmly by the challenges comrades face together.~
@75   = ~Minsc's finer qualities outweigh his lack of wits. Indeed, I oft observed how his good heart led him to find a way that a passing clever man would not see.~
@76   = ~You are right, Dynaheir. I spoke unkindly, and I apologize.~
@77   = ~*wink* Is it his heart or his hamster - that's the question.~
@78   = ~Let us put it this way - I am no lover of hamsters. You would not be without Minsc, and that is the only reason I stand his antics.~
@79   = ~Indeed, thou hast been very convincing. I can see how a passing wise woman may prefer a hamster's company to a man's.~
@80   = ~'Tis strange. Never have I heard of maidens fancying hamsters over men. It must be a local mindset.~
@81   = ~That I can do no less than the next woman.~
@82   = ~Indeed, we look after each other. But not in the way thou hast suggested. We are bonded to protect one another, not promised in marriage.~
@83   = ~It gladdens my heart to hear it.~
@84   = ~I see not why thou would'st be concerned 'bout a lack of wits in thy companions. Thou hast thyself enough and to spare.~
@85   = ~Thou art correct. I will not be without Minsc. He is my loyal companion and friend.~
@86   = ~An attachment of that kind is an unnecessary load for a traveler, <CHARNAME>. Sadness of the heart maketh us blind to the world. Thus I have no attachment presently.~
@87   = ~My suspicions are true then. Thou art of Bhaal's seed.~
@88   = ~You know, Dynaheir, I just hate people who keep their knowledge a secret, and then smile wryly and say, 'I thought so all along...'~
@89   = ~You have advice for me, haven't you?~
@90   = ~So what? Everyone is someone's seed.~
@91   = ~Not much is known of the prophecy of Alaundo, <CHARNAME>. Even less is clear. Thou wert but an orphaned child marked strangely by fate when I met thee. There was blood spilt about thee, but still different from what the prophecy sayeth.~
@92   = ~What does it say? What is my destiny?~
@93   = ~I think you were right about not telling me of your suspicions earlier. Do not tell me any more now!~
@94   = ~'Tis the same advice I ever give thee: 'Be wary.' With but one difference: 'Be as wary of thyself as of others.' Thy prophecy is a cold and dark one.~
@95   = ~What does it say? What is my destiny?~
@96   = ~Indeed. But be wary of thyself and thy wishes, <CHARNAME>. Be ever alert. Thy prophecy is cold and dark.~
@97   = ~A wise choice. That way what was said would not sway thy decisions. But be wary.~
@98   = ~The words I saw were few, yet chilling.
Armies march and cities burn
The rivers froth with tainted blood
The corpses of those born not innocent
Feed the inferno of boiling hate.~
@99   = ~That's the prophecy? Huh, Alaundo should have hired a bard to make his verses rhyme at least! What mumbo-jumbo!~
@100  = ~You scare me, Dynaheir. Is there more?~
@101  = ~These words... They make my heart leap! Am I born to lead great armies and conquer the world? Oh, Dynaheir, thank you!~
@102  = ~'Tis but a small part of the prophecy. The words of ancient sages oft make little sense, until they come true.~
@103  = ~I know no more than that.~
@104  = ~I feared that thou would'st say so.~
@105  = ~Yes, Branwen? Thou hast kept thine eyes upon me for some time now. What troubles thee?~
@106  = ~Ah, yes, well, um, mageling, that is to say-~
@107  = ~Though I allow thee some latitude for thine obvious distress, 'twould be more proper, not to mention less insulting, if I were called by my proper name. Thou know'st it, so make use of it.~
@108  = ~Yes, ah, Dynaheir. Have you considered sharpening your, ah, battle skills somewhat? Truly, if it were not for your Minsc, there have been times when you would have been sliced near to shreds, and surely the gnoll incident is not beyond your recall-~
@109  = ~No, 'tis not. Yet, Minsc is here by my side now, and will be for the foreseeable future, thus what my balls of flame cannot handle, his strength of arm surely will. And why would I even consider 'sharpening my battle skills', priestess of Tempus? I have no aptitude for such and would sooner be willing to take up a well-strung harp. I swear, thou wouldst attempt to train Boo in the wielding of flails if the beast held still long enough.~
@110  = ~My apologies, ma- um, Dynaheir, but I truly think 'twould be best if you spent just a little more time working on your archery, at least. Tempus has shown me that you cannot always depend on magic, nor on your comrade, stalwart though he be.~
@111  = ~I am sure Tempus hath, priestess. Now grant a great favor to me and still thy lips.~
@112  = ~No, Dynaheir, you do not understand! Tempus has *shown* me these things. 'Twas in a dream I had of late. I know it sounds like the foolishness of children barely out of swaddling clothes, but 'twas so very vivid! I dreamt of Minsc in rage yet helpless, of creatures arrogant and cruel that laughed as your mighty spells rolled off them as droplets off the back of a water fowl.~
@113  = ~I know you do not place your faith where I do, but I cannot believe Tempus would send me this dream if there were no meaning to it. Please do take caution, Dynaheir. Though I find your methods of battle less than perfect, I have no wish to see you harmed.~
@114  = ~Well... I see thou hast some sentiment in thy heart after all, Branwen. Yet dreams are strange things, and oft may be stirred up by nothing more than a bite of undercooked meat or a stressful day. And 'twould appear that every day spent in a band such as this is cause for stress. Still, if it puts thee more at ease, I shall be on my guard.~
@115  = ~A Huhrong is an Iron Lord of Rashemen, but little I knew that I should meet a lord full-dressed in iron. Art thou not weary, Ajantis?~
@116  = ~Nay, my Lady. The weight of the plate is noble; it does not bend a knight's back as his poor bundle bends a peasant.~
@117  = ~Doth it not restrict thy movement? Why, even Minsc, whose strength exceedeth that of a man of ordinary stature, hath no liking for armour.~
@118  = ~It is more a matter of training and discipline than one of strength to adjust to fighting in plate. While your companion is undeniably a strong man, both other qualities are somewhat lacking.~
@119  = ~Discipline... 'tis not what is valued in Rashemi berserkers.~
@120  = ~Child, thou hast been skipping about for nearly two turns of an hourglass! If thou dost not need to rest thy legs, take pity on mine eyes, at least. 'Tis like watching a fair on the Midsummer day.~
@121  = ~Dynaheir, have you ever been in love?~
@122  = ~Child... art thou in love?~
@123  = ~But of course I am! I am always in love! How can one not be in love!~
@124  = ~'Tis quite possible, child. In my experience the majority of people are not in love as a rule, and in love as an exception.~
@125  = ~You are too stuffy! Or is it a part of Wychlaran's training? Are you allowed to fall in love with a man? Can you marry?~
@126  = ~I can, but I would not make a gleeman's performance of it.~
@127  = ~Heh, you *are* stuffy!~
@128  = ~I admire thy wish and thy perseverance in following thy calling, priestess.~
@129  = ~I serve Tempus and no other path gladdens my soul. Once you have chosen the right thing, the rest comes easy. Was that not your case too, Dynaheir?~
@130  = ~'Tis not true, Branwen. Once a talent for arts magical is espied in a girl-child of Rashemi, she is made to follow the path of the Hathran. 'Tis a high station among my people, yet each of my sisters maketh sacrifices to achieve it.~
@131  = ~Sacrifices? What do you mean?~
@132  = ~Another child grew in my stead with my parents, whilst I was tutored among the Hathran.~
@133  = ~Your fate was sealed by others and you never protested?~
@134  = ~'Twas not an unfortunate decision in my case. I have heard no Hathran speak otherwise. Othlors are wise, and I have no doubt they choose appropriately whom to put through the training.~
@135  = ~Thy nimble-fingered sort is of use whilst adventuring.~
@136  = ~Am I complimented at last by the lady whose heart is as cold as the land of her birth?~
@137  = ~I have come to appreciate thine agility with locks, traps and arrows. Alas, I cannot help but be puzzled by thy clumsiness in thy personal life. By the Three, even my bodyguard Minsc would act cleverer than thou at times!~
@138  = ~Must you spoil the whole thing with a scold, Dynaheir?~
@139  = ~Thou wishest me to speak without sincerity?~
@140  = ~No, no. I simply wanted you to stop a little bit earlier. Then you would still sound sincere and I would have been well pleased to hear your words. Paying compliments, Dynaheir, is a... ahem... an art you are not aware of, I am afraid.~
@141  = ~Indeed, I am practiced in different arts than thou, Coran.~
@142  = ~Thou art at thy task again, Edwin? Is it pleasurable enough?~
@143  = ~Even if your poor attempts at sarcasm were slightly better than those of an illiterate halfling, they would not divert my attention! I am watching you, and it is quite encouraging that you are so displeased by it. (Yes, an irritated enemy is far better than a calm and composed one.)~
@144  = ~Thou must be the first amongst thy kin who hath taken to Helm's faith, then. 'Twill make the Tharchion of Surthay proud.~
@145  = ~Your babbling makes no sense as usual, Rashemi witch. It serves as a good example of why Thay has to pursue its interests in Rashemen. You simians are all born without reasoning power, and must be enslaved to fulfill your destiny of furthering Thay's might.~
@146  = ~Hast thou succumbed to madness, or dost thou truly think that I would be fooled by thy lies? Thy bearing giveth out that thou art an Odesseiron not merely in name, but thou art of noble birth. I must conclude from it that thou art kin to Homen Odesseiron, the Tharchion of Surthay himself. Disprove me if thou wilt, but I sense that 'tis the truth of the matter.~
@147  = ~You are about to overwhelm whatever passes for your intellect with these pathetic insinuations. I suggest that you stop fantasizing about me and concentrate on being marginally successful at casting those pathetic one-and-a-half spells that you managed to inscribe in your spell-book. (If Homen wanted to keep the power over Surthay, he would have elevated a person of my outstanding abilities to an appropriately high position. Instead, I have to walk on foot through a barbaric country with a Wychlaran for company!)~
@148  = ~Thou art wronging the person needlessly, Edwin. 'Tis not Homen's fault that thou art not advancing, but thine own. I hear that the Tarchion hath a semblance of honor, and that he seeketh to advance those who possess finer qualities, uncommon in thy people and unknown in thee.~
@149  = ~I bear no love for thee. Indeed, one might say that I bear thee none at all.~
@150  = ~Are you a rich witch?~
@151  = ~A Hathran, such as I, hath little material wealth.~
@152  = ~Then I do not see why I should bother with your dislike.~
@153  = ~Thou show'st little care for the maiden thou name'st thy lover, and thou art oblivious that thy comrades would rather have a poisonous snake in their midst than thee! Thou art a poor man, Eldoth, for thou dost not value either love or friendship.~
@154  = ~You suggest that I should put some woman's sigh and the opinion of some scum chance met on the road ahead of my comfort, my sustenance and my interest?~
@155  = ~Those of thy calling more oft sing of such things with reverence, not scold them.~
@156  = ~The untalented fools can scream their throats sore. Let the stupid praise virtuous sons of the rich and powerful, who are oh! so humble, tender and loyal! I cannot afford to be noble. For if I won't look after myself, who will?~
@157  = ~If thou hadst a true friend or lover thou wouldst know the answer.~
@158  = ~Oh, fear not, my lovers do take care of me, 'true' or not.~
@159  = ~I foresee an early demise for thee, druid, if thou persist in thy destructive ways.~
@160  = ~I will return to the Great Mother's embrace when she calls me, Dynaheir. Whether it be sooner or later makes no difference to me.~
@161  = ~It would be wasteful, as any death for a folly.~
@162  = ~Folly? Grrr! You call returning balance to the world a folly?~
@163  = ~Why think'st thou that the world is unbalanced?~
@164  = ~Because the civilizations destroy the Great Mother!~
@165  = ~I have no more liking for destruction than thyself, Faldorn. But civilization doth not destroy without building. Where ere stood a forest now a city rises tall. Mayhap civilization is part of the balance presently?~
@166  = ~No, Dynaheir, you can reconcile the Great Mother with civilization, no more than you can reconcile Nature's true servants with her despoilers!~
@167  = ~Thou listen'st not to reason, Faldorn.~
@168  = ~The Shadow Druids are the ones who see things in the true light! Why should I listen to the rambling of disbelievers?~
@169  = ~Thy happy nature is pleasing, Garrick. One doth not oft encounter such a merry person.~
@170  = ~Ah, Dynaheir, you surely are wrong. There are plenty of happy people around! Life is glorious, how can anyone be unhappy?~
@171  = ~In more ways than thou canst imagine, Garrick.~
@172  = ~Ah, show me a man unhappy, and I shall fix his mood with a jolly song in a matter of minutes.~
@173  = ~Thou suppose'st?~
@174  = ~I do not suppose, I know it! Look, Dynaheir, whenever a poetic melancholy grips at my heart, I only have to whistle a couple of verses of 'A Knight and a Basket of Turnips' and the dark cloud of sadness is... POOF! Gone for good!~
@175  = ~Mayhap thou canst teach it to me next time I feel a longing for my homeland? Ever it maketh me sad.~
@176  = ~Uh... Ma'am, maybe not that particular song... I know many others just as jolly.~
@177  = ~Canst thou tell me of thy childhood, Imoen?~
@178  = ~Huh, not much to tell there, ma'am. I was orphaned early, and a good man Winthrop took me in. Heh, good but boring. I'd still be working in his inn, if we hadn't run away. Heh, that was fun... Except of course for Gorion dying.~
@179  = ~Thou wert a friend to <CHARNAME>?~
@180  = ~Yep. Funny sort <PRO_HESHE> is, but I knew <PRO_HIMHER> for as long as I can remember myself and in the end <PRO_HESHE> isn't all that bad.~
@181  = ~Funny? What dost thou mean, funny?~
@182  = ~Oh, I mean that eight foot tail <CHARNAME> has.~
@183  = ~Tail? What kind of a tail?~
@184  = ~The blue one with purple stripes. *giggles* C'mon, Dynaheir, don't you understand I'm joking?~
@185  = ~Thou wert joking? Nevertheless, what didst thou mean by <CHARNAME> being funny?~
@186  = ~Uh... I dunno. I guess I meant that <PRO_HESHE> is fun to be around. Hey, why are you even asking about me and <CHARNAME>?~
@187  = ~'Tis good to know thy companions, Imoen.~
@188  = ~Aha! Maybe you can tell me of yourself? How old are you? What does your name mean? And why they all call you witch? And why did you come here to the Sword Coast?~
@189  = ~Time hath run short for talking now, Imoen. I shall tell thee more of myself some other time.~
@190  = ~Jaheira, canst thou tell me what kind of herb this is? It hath a strong fragrance, refreshing and soothing both.~
@191  = ~Mhmm, yes. This is arrowmint, prized by incense-makers and for its antiseptic properties.~
@192  = ~A medicinal herb, thou sayest? Doth it need to be specially prepared?~
@193  = ~No, while it can be used in salves, it is most effective when the fresh leaves are crushed and applied directly to a wound.~
@194  = ~Most interesting. I thank thee for sharing thy knowledge with me. While I am well-versed in the herbal lore of my home, many of the plants that grow in these lands are unknown to me.~
@195  = ~Nature provides well for her children, and I am glad to assist anyone who appreciates her bounty.~
@196  = ~I am much interested in the organization called Harpers.~
@197  = ~A stranger from afar, such as I, hath very little chance to gain knowledge of what is hidden even from those who dwell in the land.~
@198  = ~Hmmm... you are a woman of decency, lest I would not tell you anything. But be warned that I cannot divulge much without... permission. Ask me, but do not be put off if I shall not give you a satisfying answer.~
@199  = ~Mostly I was wondering how would one join with the Harpers?~
@200  = ~As I said, I know little of the Harpers, but you seem to be the sort they might be interested in. They... they will find a way to communicate with you if you are needed.~
@201  = ~'Twas woman's curiosity, Jaheira, thou dost understand? Merely curiosity. I shall not like to meddle into causes outside those that concern Rashemen, or those that uphold goodness if it is threatened.~
@202  = ~I hope that your curiosity is now sated.~
@203  = ~Indeed, and quite sufficiently so, Jaheira. I thank thee for this chat.~
@204  = ~Thou art a caravan master, Kagain?~
@205  = ~Nae, my business be to see to a caravan's safe travel.~
@206  = ~Hast thou traveled with caravans?~
@207  = ~Aye, here and there.~
@208  = ~I studied many maps, but I have not heard of a country named Here and for that matter neither I came across There.~
@209  = ~So what? Go study yer scrolls some more. Mayhap ye'd find it. By Moradin's hammer, beardless wench, dinnae ye know when to leave a fightin' man alone?~
@210  = ~Thou art uncouth.~
@211  = ~No respectable dwarf would go answering some mage's stupid questions for hours, and that's still not enough fer ye?~
@212  = ~By my reckoning, no respectable dwarf would wander the land away from his clan either.~
@213  = ~Ye betcha he would! Now, stop tempting me axe, wench. It be thirsty fer blood!~
@214  = ~Khalid, 'tis strange to see a competent and intelligent warrior display such a lack of self-confidence. Is something troubling thee?~
@215  = ~N-no. Well... yes. But I d-don't really want to talk about it. Those m-memories are too painful, and I would prefer to forget them.~
@216  = ~I see. Forgive me, then, I did not wish to cause thee any discomfort. Have a care, though, not to let thy troubles consume thee.~
@217  = ~I will do my best. But thanks for your c-concern, Dynaheir.~
@218  = ~Rest assured that they will not. I will see to that.~
@219  = ~I do not have much training in Elven lore, as 'tis not of immediate concern to Rashemi. Still, I wish to learn more of thy people.~
@220  = ~Would you have me tell you of my kin's history, custom and spirit while we are breaking for a meal or resting our feet, Dynaheir?~
@221  = ~I shall try not to overwhelm thee with my curiosity. However, the road is long indeed and we have much time to banter.~
@222  = ~That is true. Besides, a friendly conversation is better than an argument. What do you wish to know, Dynaheir?~
@223  = ~Firstly, thy name puzzles me. It doth not sound akin to the elven names I have heard afore meeting with thee. Those wert quite a mouthful.~
@224  = ~My mother chose a name which suited her mood and was pleasing. It is not uncommon among elves, but outside of my native Shilmista it would be pronounced differently: Kethvan - the 'forest wind'.~
@225  = ~'Tis certainly interesting.~
@226  = ~Minsc! By the Three, fall back lest this battle be thy last!~
@227  = ~RAAARGH! What-what was that, Boo? Our witch is calling?~
@228  = ~MINSC! Cease thy prattling with that rodent and fall back NOW!~
@229  = ~Evil should fall, not Minsc! But I will do as Dynaheir commands... Ugh... I need some aid. Poor Boo gets so skittish when he sees Minsc bleed.~
@230  = ~Quickly, a healer! Rest thyself, Minsc, thy wounds are grievous.~
@231  = ~Minsc is not afraid to be wounded in defense of his witch. I will not let evil touch you again, Dynaheir. Better to die on the battlefield than to live with that shame, knowing I could never look my hamster in the eye again.~
@232  = ~Thy devotion is commendable, yet a dead man can protect no one, and neither would I wish to miss thy faithful company. Have a care, Minsc, and do not let thine own battle-fury bring thee low needlessly!~
@233  = ~Minsc, mine heart always gladdens as I behold thee by my side. 'Tis hard to be far from one's homeland and familiar faces.~
@234  = ~You have two friendly faces! Minsc and Boo - the two heroes who are here to defend you. The stuff of legend! Oh, those tales that will be told of us in the Beserkers Lodge when we get home! Right, Boo?~
@235  = ~Minsc, it might be well afore I would return back to Rashemen. Dost thou wish to go home sooner, thou needest only tell me. Thy dejemma is all but fulfilled now.~
@236  = ~[MINSC 28] Where Dynaheir goes, so goes my blade. As long as there are evil butts to kick and some cheese for Boo - Minsc is happy!~
@237  = ~My loyal friend, I most appreciate thy words. But I perceive that I have found that which I have been seeking. If I am to believe the lore of the olden days, many events perilous are about to come to pass.~
@238  = ~Minsc and Boo are not afraid of danger! You started your travel with Minsc and Boo and with Minsc and Boo you will travel! I will not let you go unprotected so far from home.~
@239  = ~Thou hast surprised me, halfling, by taking over my kitchen duty yestereve.~
@240  = ~Better'n hearin' Xzar squeal agin 'bout what ye serves up as grub.~
@241  = ~Still, 'twas generous of thee.~
@242  = ~Heh. Not so much. There's me own innards t' think of, too, y' know.~
@243  = ~I had not dreamt to be relieved of the chore by thee. I rather expected threats.~
@244  = ~Time them threats worked any improvement in yer meals, we'd all be starved t' death. Easier all around, I just does it meself.~
@245  = ~It arouses my curiosity. Are all the masters of thy combine as practical as thyself?~
@246  = ~Dunno. Mostly, I ain't met 'em. Out here, there ain't much choice. In town? I'd be hollerin' fer a new cook louder'n any o' 'em.~
@247  = ~Thy willingness to make the best of matters suggests to me that perhaps the Zhentarim are not so brutally aggressive as tavern tales paint them.~
@248  = ~I espied that thou boast'st only of thy brain, Quayle, and never of thy looks. Why, that even giveth thee depth, I may say. Thou surely placest the intelligence above appearances.~
@249  = ~Would you be able to comprehend the enormity of my brain, if I did not speak up?~
@250  = ~I doubt it.~
@251  = ~Aha! And everyone can see as plain as day that I am extraordinarily good-looking. It wouldn't be *modest* to announce the length of my nose in the midst of you, who have nothing spectacular neither on the inside nor the outside of the attic department.~
@252  = ~I remember now that gnomes consider a grand nose desirable.~
@253  = ~Definitely, ma'am. Is it not plain to see? Such curvature! Such majesty!~
@254  = ~Thou art quite gifted in that regard, I cannot deny. And that boil doth make thy nose to appear even grander.~
@255  = ~What? I do not have any boils on my nose!~
@256  = ~Thou art right. I can see now that 'tis thy head, not a boil.~
@257  = ~Now, Dynaheir, that was *not* funny!~
@258  = ~Whilst I look at thee I am reminded of an old Rashemi joke.~
@259  = ~Dynaheir, darling, when I look at you, the last thing I would suspect is that you would know what a joke is. But by all means, do tell it, and let us share a good laugh. A smile ever suits me.~
@260  = ~Puzzle this out: how many Thayvian women doth it take to pour out a glass of water?~
@261  = ~And?~
@262  = ~None. A Thayvian woman will make a man to do it for her.~
@263  = ~That's no joke, it's good advice. Helplessness is a woman's main weapon.~
@264  = ~Then why art thou carrying thy bow, Safana? Why art thou not relying on thy male friends to protect thee?~
@265  = ~Oh, Dynaheir, but who would attend to the important task of defending my precious life better than myself? That's not pouring a glass of water, after all.~
@266  = ~Thou spendst a great deal of time striving to excel in fighting.~
@267  = ~And you are a bookworm. Let me be.~
@268  = ~Yet I am far afield, and not unarmed, whilst thou hast tried to wipe thy bloodstained weapon with a rare scroll.~
@269  = ~That parchment? It was from the spoils of someone I vanquished! I will do with them as I please!~
@270  = ~Thou hast proven thyself quite a warrior, Shar-Teel, but thou must learn to respect the talents of thy companions and use them most advantageously.~
@271  = ~Companions? If that lousy male did not defeat me, I would still be doing my own thing. And that's how I like it. I fight alone!~
@272  = ~Thou art most unwise if thou dost not understand that traveling with a group is a necessity in these troubled times. Strength is in numbers.~
@273  = ~Strength is in the sword arm, wizard.~
@274  = ~Thou hast been taught much history? We have that in common then. I studied in some detail the happenings from the times of Raumathar and Narfell until present days.~
@275  = ~Ah, yes! Good old Ancient Empires! My tutor was fascinated by the endless wars they waged on each other. He made me write a dozen essays on who won those wars. In the end, I told him that nobody won.~
@276  = ~Thou wert right, Skie.~
@277  = ~Huh, my tutor did not think so. He spent hours telling me how Narfell is still a nation in its own right and that is why it should be considered a victor.~
@278  = ~But I think - Narfell has nothing of its former glory remaining, and its people are no longer what they used to be. To me it's clear that Narfell was destroyed, as well as Raumathar! What kind of a victory is that?~
@279  = ~Thou speak'st wisely. Indeed, the victory can be ascribed to neither side in such circumstances. Thy tutor's judgment was superficial.~
@280  = ~I know! It was so unfair!~
@281  = ~Besides, dost thou know that Raumatharai's descendants, the Raumvira, still live by the Lake of Mists? We, Rashemi, consider ourselves to be amongst those who descended from them as well.~
@282  = ~Art thou interested in the politics of the present day, Skie?~
@283  = ~Ahem, lately I've been sort of cut off from events... With my father locking me away and all.~
@284  = ~Mine enquiry was about the impending war betwixt the nations of Baldur's Gate and Amn.~
@285  = ~Impending? My father says that it is all the doings of some lunatic who blows rumors out of proportion. There's not going to be any war.~
@286  = ~Thou sound'st very sure.~
@287  = ~Well, that's what my father says.~
@288  = ~Thou trust'st thy father's judgment in the matters of politics? Why dost thou not trust that he wishes thee well, trying to protect thee from thy unseemly lover?~
@289  = ~Dynaheir! Don't you go attacking my poor Eldoth too! He loves me! That's all that matters! Not his birth, nor his means!~
@290  = ~I have no words to express my disappointment, but be it as thou wishest - I will not say another word against thy mate.~
@291  = ~Away from me! Thine allegiance to Cyric renders thee untrustworthy, even if thou wert not so obviously insane.~
@292  = ~Cyric is the true god of all, witch! Any who would deny his glory surely have a few screws loose in their heads! Tiax will smite all of Cyric's enemies when the day of judgement comes, so best you reconsider your allegiances before Tiax rules all!~
@293  = ~Cyric is a god of bloodshed and evil. Thine allegiance to such a monster makes thee a monster as well, and I shall have no dealings with thee!~
@294  = ~Now, as I said, away from me and bother me no more with thy wickedness!~
@295  = ~Pave the path to your own damnation if ye will, fool! Tiax shall rule all, and when he does you shall beg and whimper to praise almighty Cyric, your throat growing hoarse from singing all of his many hymns of worship, your robe stained with the blood of the many sacrifices you shall offer up in his unholy name... And it shall be far, far too late, for your words will have already condemned you! Repent now, or suffer later! So commands Cyric!~
@296  = ~Viconia, in appearance thou art the opposite of what Shar is. Thy hair is white, not the color of a raven's wing, whilst thy skin is black, not pale. Would thy coloring be opposite, thou would'st be prized amongst Shar's devotees.~
@297  = ~Shar accepted me without regard to my coloring. She is not like other sufacers, those who would seek my death because of it.~
@298  = ~Mayhaps the reason layeth beneath the skin? I have heard it said that thou art guilty of many murders.~
@299  = ~As I've said before: they are all lies! And you dare to contest my words? I am not one to be taken lightly!~
@300  = ~A mercenary wished to attack a group of no small power to take thee down. Would a hireling give his life for a lie?~
@301  = ~Of course he would! Males are but good servants; they do as they are told. Their lives are of secondary importance.~
@302  = ~I foresee that thou wilt see much trouble if thou keep'st speaking in such ways.~
@303  = ~Xan, while I must commend thee on thine arcane skills, thy constant doomsaying is quite detrimental to the group's morale.~
@304  = ~'Doomsaying'? Realism is what it is. Would you rather have me prance around in suicidal merriment, like your bodyguard does, while the tangled web of our many enemies tightens around us?~
@305  = ~Minsc is... Minsc. Insult him not, for he is my faithful companion and wise in his own way.~
@306  = ~'Doomsaying'? Realism is what it is. Would you rather have me prance around in suicidal merriment, like your bodyguard did, while the tangled web of our many enemies tightens around us? I will not rush to meet my doom, like he did.~
@307  = ~Minsc was... Minsc. Disparage not his memory, for he was my faithful companion and wise in his own way. His death will be avenged, this I swear by the Three.~
@308  = ~And thou hast not answered my question, Xan. Why is even the brightest day filled with such shadow for thee?~
@309  = ~You can see as well as I do that our leader seems Abyss-bent on making everybody's lives as miserable as possible before our inevitable demise.~
@310  = ~Then let us strive to make <PRO_HIMHER> change <PRO_HISHER> ways, for surely that will accomplish more than simply bemoaning them all day long.~
@311  = ~You may consider our leader's selflessly 'heroic' streak admirable, witch, but I do not. Tempting death at every opportunity <PRO_HESHE> gets will only hasten our downfall.~
@312  = ~'Tis admirable, yes, for some causes are indeed worth the risk. Surely thou canst not deny that we have fared quite well so far - due no doubt to caution, but also to skill and wits, including thine own. Take pride in them and in our accomplishments instead of mocking them, like thou dost now.~
@313  = ~While our leader is showing some promise, it will be futile in the end. Our enemies are both numerous and powerful, and we likely will not be able to avoid their assassins much longer.~
@314  = ~Every enemy has a weakness, even the most powerful. Let us bend our talents to the task of finding this weakness, then. Caution is vital, but numb fear is the enemy's weapon.~
@315  = ~One beholds things of rare magnificence whilst on an adventure.~
@316  = ~My adventuring experience must have been quite different from yours, Dynaheir. I found that the interiors of the Nashkel Mines lacked the most primitive conveniences, let alone magnificence.~
@317  = ~I speak of thy Moonblade, elfman.~
@318  = ~Ah, I should have guessed. No wonder it attracts so much attention after our predecessors, in their foolish lightheartedness, failed to sustain but a mere two or three hundred Moonblades! They believe that those swords protect Elvendom, and even now, when it is clear that we will inevitably lose every one of them, they are still unaware of their impending doom.~
@319  = ~Talking to thee, Xan, maketh me think about a great desert in which each sand grain bears the word 'despair' on its side. It maketh me thirst threefold for the living waters of hope.~
@320  = ~Have a care, Zhent. I like not thy manner of regarding <CHARNAME>.~
@321  = ~Well, <PRO_HESHE> is rather an interesting person, no?~
@322  = ~Ah! <PRO_HESHE> is a spawn of Bhaal! Thou know'st this!~
@323  = ~But... Er... Apart from that, you know... That is to say... Mummy?~
@324  = ~There is no 'apart from that'. Thou wert plainly dreaming of the foul magics thou might'st weave about this one.~
@325  = ~See here! I'm quite fond of <CHARNAME>. We've been through so much together and... There's no harm in dreaming, surely. No imminent shortage of Bhaalspawn in the offing, I mean. Plenty of fish in that sea, aren't there?~
@326  = ~'Tis well thou art no fisherman, casting thy lines so clumsily. I tell thee, Zhent, thou wouldst tamper with the prophecies and unleash Bhaal upon the Realms once more.~
@327  = ~I don't claim to be a religious fellow, but Bhaal... Could do worse. That's what Monty always used to say. Monty? Why, I'd wager you have no *idea* of the wondrous things that may be done with the skull, a parricide, for instance.~
@328  = ~I have not. Nor, *I* should wager, hast thou. Be content with thy dreams, then, and consider how ill it would bode for thy prospects, should the Zhentarim learn that thou hast failed in their trust merely to slake thine own ambitions.~
@329  = ~Yissss! 'To each matter its proper season', isn't it? To each and *every* matter. Witch!~
@330  = ~Art thou Sembian, Yeslick?~
@331  = ~Nay, missus Dynaheir. Though I lived in Sembia for a time, aye. Been smithing there, that's so.~
@332  = ~Minsc and I, we passed through Sembia, but I saw little of the country, as we were making haste.~
@333  = ~What was ye hurry?~
@334  = ~'Tis of no import, Yeslick. But I ever seek to learn more. Mayhap thou canst tell me of Sembia?~
@335  = ~Missus, I told ye, I was smithing. I do not mingle in politics and such other things that interest ye nosy sort.~
@336  = ~But surely thou noticed the custom of the land?~
@337  = ~The custom was as such - I did the work, they paid coin.~
@338  = ~Hast thou ever looked away from thy forge, dwarf?~
@339  = ~Dynaheir, fer me all lands are the same, except mine ancestor's hold, and 'tis lost under water.~
